I have been working on my online resume. I wanted to start from scratch, without using any templates, bootstrap, or anything pre-built. I started my design with the new Google Material Design in mind. A the navigation and footer buttons are inspired more from Twitter's buttons than Google's. I used the Meyer reset in my stylesheet, but everything else was coded from scratch. I was able to incorporate a few new to me technologies and resources. Just like this blog I am using Prepros to preprocess my SCSS into CSS as well as minify the small amount of jquery I used for the go to top button, and the smooth transitions to each section.

I also made a print style sheet that allows this single page resume to be printed on two pages, with the second page only showing my skills. The font was changed to Georgia which is a better font to be used on print, as well as further styling to each section to make it look like how I would style my resume if I were to use a word processor. Please try to print my resume and see how it looks!

Thanks for checking it out!
