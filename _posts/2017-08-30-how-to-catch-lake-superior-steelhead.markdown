Minnesota is full of lakes, rivers, and streams that provide us with a large variety of fishing opportunities. The most sought after fish for most Minnesota anglers is most likely the walleye, crappies, or bass. Many anglers take long trips to Red, Mille Lacs, Lake of the Woods, Leech, and many other popular lakes looking for big walleye or crappies, but many overlook Lake Superior as their main destination.

I am writing this because after moving to Duluth I spent most of my time figuring out how to catch these common fish species thinking that without boating out on Lake Superior I wouldn't have an opportunity to catch any of the fish that inhabited the big lake (Superior). It's not that I feel a wasted opportunity not getting into steelheading and shore fishing for loopers (kamloop rainbow trout) and coho, but I did think there was a large barrier to entry. Without $1000s worth of boating equipment or fly-fishing gear. How was I supposed get an opportunity at these fish?

So the first thing you need to know is that trout fishing Lake Superior and its tributaries can be as easy or as complicated as you want it to be. You also need to take advantage of opportunities. Throughout the year there will be places you can go to catch these fish, but knowing when to go, where to go, what to use will be the key to getting that tug on the end of your line.
