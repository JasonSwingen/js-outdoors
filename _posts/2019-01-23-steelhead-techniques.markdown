<blockquote>Steelhead, the fish of 1,000 casts... Make sure each of them counts!</blockquote>

When I first started steelheading it was crazy to think that you could tie on a fly or colorful ball of yarn the size of your fingernail, toss it into a muddy fast moving river and somehow catch a steelhead. It took me an entire season to get my first steelhead on the fly and looking back at my flies and the technique I was using, it was no wonder I didn't catch any. Skip the learning curve and use these proven techniques!

<!-- Ever since I caught my first steelhead I have been doing research, talking with local fisherman, <a href="/fishing/northern-minnesota-fishing-resources/" title="Northern Minnesota Fly Fishing Resources">looking up local fly fishing resources</a>, and trying out new techniques, flies, hooks, weight, rods, fly lines and all of the other <a href="/fishing/steelhead-equipment/" title="Fly Fishing Gear for Lake Superior Steelhead">fly fishing gear you need on the north shore</a> to find out for myself some of the best tactics to catch Lake Superior steelhead with a fly rod. -->

## Learning a New Steelheading Technique

The main reason for needing an arsenal of steelheading techniques is because the water (especially on the north shore of Lake Superior) is constantly changing. During the early spring season the water will be fast and muddy with all of the snow melting and by the end of the spring season the water will be low, slow, and clear. Fishing the same way in these different conditions will not give you the best presentation in all situations. Below are the types of techniques that will be covered. I will cover when and why to use each technique as well as how to rig each specific setup.

### Rigging (The Foundation)

I'll assume you already have a fly rod and reel, but if you don't or have questions about gear selection check out my recent post on <a href="http://js-outdoors.com/fishing/steelhead-equipment/">fly fishing gear needed to catch a steelhead</a>.

Each of these techniques starts out with the same or at least a very similar rigging foundation. This is especiallaly important when you want adapt to the conditions you are fishing. Water conditions can change daily if not hourly on the north shore of Lake Superior and you may need to switch tactics. Rigging your rod to easily switch between tight-line setup and indicator setups can save you time and allow you to fish in pools, buckets, tail-outs, and riffles without needing to bring an arsenal of fly rods and reels with you.

I usually start out with 20lb of backing to fill the reel and allow to faster retreival of my fly line. I will then either use fly line, running line, or monofilament. Most often I use fly line, but pack an extra spool loaded up with running line. Using monofilament or running line will allow you to fish with more sensitivity and less drag, but fly line lets you fish larger rivers and is easier to handle in cold weather. Each of these three lines choices have there pros and cons, but they all will work for each type of technique I'm going to cover in this article. Whatever line you choose the rigging formula from the leader down to the flies will stay the same.

**Fly Line**

-    20lb Dacron Backing - Weight Forward Fly Line - 4’ 20lb mono - 4’ 15lb flouro - swivel/tippet ring

**Running Line**

-    20lb Dacron Backing - 40lb Running Line - 4’ 20lb mono - 4’ 15lb flouro - swivel/tippet ring

**Monofilament**

-    20lb Dacron Backing - 10lb Monofilament - swivel/tippet ring

### Nymphing

<p>Out of all the different ways to catch steelhead, nymphing is by far the most common and easiest way to catch a steelhead. However, there are multiple different presentations you can use that allow your nymph to get in the right zone and drift in a natural way. Each one works better in different water depths, flows, and clarity. The chart below shows a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the most ideal condition for each technique.</p>

<h4 id="tight">Tight Line Nymphing</h4>

If you are fishing close dirty water and want to be as versitile as possible tight line nymphing may be your best option. You will need a sensitive and somewhat lightweight rod since you are feeling for a fish and not visually watching an indicator.

#### Chuck-n-Duck

There is nothing elegant about this type of fishing. You add a bunch of weight to your line, add a fly and huck it all upstream. This technique is most beneficial in deep, short runs (very common on the north shore) especially when the water is fast and muddy. However, it is a very versatile technique that you can be used nearly any time of year and in any water condition. Not only does it keep your fly down in the strike-zone longer, but you can fish nearly any water depth without changing any of your rigging, other than adjusting the size or amount of split shot.

The downside to this technique is that it is fairly common to foul hook fish. Snagging fish is not always avoidable, but some anglers use this technique unethically. Try to avoid using this technique if you are sight fishing, and don't set the hook randomly though your drift hoping to snag fish.

##### Three different ways to rig your weight

-   **Drop Shot** _(My first choice)_
    -   Drop Shotting allows you to change the size and amount of split shot easily, change the length and weight of your leader, and because you aren't putting split shot directly on your main line, your won't risk weakening your main line crimping on split-shot.
    -   **Rigging:** To fish this way you will either need to use a small swivel, tippet ring, or use a line to line knot like the <a href="http://js-outdoors.com/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Blood">blood knot</a>. You can either use straight mono, or tie on a 10-12ft leader of 10-15lb fluorocarbon then attach a swivel or tippet ring. Leave the tag end of your line unclipped and roughly 3-4 inches long. I like to tie a single overhand knot at the end then crimp on my split shot. Then tie on a section of 6-8lb fluorocarbon tippet to the other end of the swivel or tippet ring and attach your favorite fly or egg pattern. You'll want to fish a lighter tippet that your main line so if you do get snagged you don't loose your entire setup, just the last foot or two of your tippet.

-   **In-line Split Shot**
    -   This way of rigging split shot should really only be used as a last resort. It is the easiest way of adding weight to your line, but because you are are crimping directly onto your line and your line will then be running closer to the rocks there is an increased risk of your line becoming damaged. Remember that the pound test line you are using is only as good as strong as its weakest part.
    -   **Rigging:** You can tie your fly directly to your leader or mono line and add split shot 1-3 feet up from your fly.

-   **Slinky Rig**
    -   The slinky rig is the best way to fish in deep or extra snaggy areas. The You can buy these or make them on your own.
        Minnesota Steelheader has a great guide on how to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/Slinkys.html">build your own slinky rigs</a>.
    -   **Rigging:** This system is rigged and fished very similarly to the drop shot method. But instead having split shot connected directly to your leader, the slinky rig is tied to a swivel can move freely up and down your leader. This method is great if you are tired of getting your split shot snagged, but it is not as versatile as the drop-shot method since you cannot add and remove weight quickly and easily.

#### Euro Nymphing

<figure class="image-right">
<img title="Euro Rig" src="/images/euro.jpg">
<figcaption>Euro Rig</figcaption>
</figure>

Euro nymphing is really a collection of multiple techniques used in Europe. You can split each technique down even further into Czech, Polish, French, and Spanish nymphing, but for all intents and purposes they are all similar enough to consider them Euro nymphing.

This technique is somewhat similar to Chuck-n-Duck fishing, but far more elegant. Instead of using split shot to get your nymph or egg pattern to the bottom, you will use a single jig-style tungsten beaded nymph. You can still use split shot if you need to fish really deep, but you need to feel the bite using this technique and split shot will take away the direct connection you have to your fly.

-    **Rigging:** This is an up close and personal technique. To have the best success Euro Nymphing you'll want a long, sensitive rod to feel the bite, but you can also tie in a section of sighter material into your leader. When you toss your fly upstream you will want to keep you rod hight and moving slightly in front of your fly keeping a slight bow in your leader. If you feel a sharp tug or see your leader straighten out then set the hook! This technique is better when the water has started to clear up, but is not so clear that you cannot get close to the water without spooking fish. You can either use straight mono or a long leader with this system as well. I also like using a <a href="http://js-outdoors.com/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Non%20Slip%20Loop">non-slip mono loop knot</a> when tying on a jigged nymph because having a knot that is not cinched down onto the eye will not hinder the natural movement of the fly and allow you to use heavier tippet.


<h3 id="suspension">Suspension Nymphing</h3>

Suspension Nymphing with an indicator can easily be thought of as putting an indicator on a chuck-n-duck or euro nymphing rig. This allows you to fish further out in pools or runs where you otherwise might not be able to reach. The other benifit to this technique is that indicators are extremely sensitive. It can be difficult especially for a new angler to _feel_ the bite of a fish, but it is pretty easy to tell when you indicator drops.

You can use fly line or mono with this technique as well. Fishing with fly line will allow you to fish further distances, but if the river has a few different speeds of current it can be difficult to get a good drag free drift.

-   **Horizontal**
    -   To make sure your fly is getting all the way to the bottom you should place your indicator one and a half times the depth of the water that you are fishing in. You should see your indicator move slightly as your split shot is ticking the bottom of the rocks. Every once and a while your indicator will stop or drop because it is snagged on a rock or branch, you should set the hook even if you think its a rock just for the odd chance that it is a fish. This technique excels in tailouts (the water at the end of a pool, just before fast water) and when fishing the seams of pools. It is very versatile because you can always take off your indicator and fish the chuch-n-duck method of nymphing without having to re-rig.
    -   **Rigging:**

-   **Vertical**
    -   Vertical indicator fishing is taking some of the techniques commonly used by centerpin anglers. You use a strike indicator or float, but instead of having all of your weight bunched together and bouncing on the bottom you evenly distribute your split shot down your line between your indicator and fly. This method works best in deep pools and clearer water.
    -   **Rigging:**

### Pro-Tip: Change Techniques Quickly
The easiest way to switch between these different techniques is to pre-tie your flies and wrap them on to a lindy rig. Especially on rivers where you can fish two flies. This also comes in handy if you break off a fly or two and don't want to waste your precious time on the river tying on flies. Try a loop to loop connection or use a no-knot fast snap to quickly snap onto a tippet ring at the end of your leader. My favorite multiple fly holder is the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carlson-Tackle-Buddy-Spinner-Holder/dp/B003FRG4AU/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1548377429&sr=8-4&keywords=tackle+buddy">Tackle Buddy</a>.

<h2 id="streamer">Streamer Fishing</h2>

Not as common on the north shore, but a very popular technique when <a href="/fishing/brule-river-steelhead/">fly fishing the Brule River</a> in Wisconsin. You can still use this technique on river mouths and larger north shore rivers.

</figure> -->

-   **Swinging Streamers**
    -   The basics of swinging streamers include casting a fly at roughly a 45 degree downstream angle and letting your streamer "swing" across the river. This is a great technique to cover lots of water as well as catch aggressive steelhead.
    -   Streamers are often swung with with the use of a specific type of two-handed (switch) rod and a (shooting head) fly line that allows you to cast weighted flies across larger rivers. These rods and line combos make fishing easier, but when fishing the smaller tributaries found on the north shore you can get away with a standard weight forward line or a sink tip line. If you need to get deeper than you can use a polyleader, a weighted fly, or even both.
    -   **Rigging:**

-   **Stripping Streamers**
    -   This type of streamer fishing should should almost be combined with swinging streamers. At the end of your swing you should slowly strip your fly back to you since a fish may have seen your fly and is waiting to strike. However, you can also strip streamers without swinging them first. Especially in slack water and deep pools.
    -   **Rigging:**

To change from nymphing to streamer fishing there are two good options. If you are fishing with running line or monofilament you can add on a shooting head and a sink tip and 3-4' of flourocarbon tippet. If you fish with fly line you can either fish with heavily weighted streamers or use a polyleader or versileader. Just remove your standard nymphing leader and add on of these leaders that turns your floating fly line into a sink tip. Just add tippet and your streamer of choice!

## Conclusion

That's it! You should now be ready to hit the water!
