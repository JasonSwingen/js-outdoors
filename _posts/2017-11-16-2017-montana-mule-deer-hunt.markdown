The cold front hit the during my drive to Montana. After hunting last year in 70 degree weather heat I was excited to get out into the rugged public lands of Montana in search for a active mature mule deer buck.

Slowly working my way to my hunting buddy Mark's house I stopped to glass a few areas as well as take some pictures.

Snow on the ground, bucks starting to rut and a mule deer tag in my pocket. I couldn't wait until morning to get out and start hiking with my rifle on my shoulder.

Mark had drawn a cow elk tag near the Missouri river breaks so we planned on hunting the rough secluded country in search of elk and a lone muley hiding in the timber. We started our hike up long Coulee where Mark had seen a few elk on opening day. After only an hour of hiking and looking up a few side draws we spotted an elk, already bedded down in the timber.

We made our first stalk

Mark and I made a quick morning hunt and spotted a few does on a hillside. Then, we saw some movement behind the hill, all we could see where the tips of this bucks antlers. We made a stock on them and got to a few hundred yards away. The deer were up and starting to move over the hill, so Mark quickly ranged him, "350" he said. I laid down and aimed a few inches over his back and pulled the trigger.
