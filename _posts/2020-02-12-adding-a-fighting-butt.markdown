Turn your regular fly rod into the ultimate Great Lakes steelheading rod with this simple modification. I've said in my previous posts on steelhead equipment that the perfect fly fishing rod is a 10' 7wt fly rod. This is the perfect weight for our (on average) 20 to 30 inch steelhead, and at 10' you can fish nearly every skinny riffle or wide pool found on the Great Lakes Tributaries.

Adding a fighting butt to your fly rod can greatly improve its versatility and  allow you to easily **switch to a shooting head system** and allow you to make a multitude of two-handed spey casts to throw streamers, as well as **give you extra power** to throw those big double-fly nymph rigs upstream. Not only does having an extra handle help in casting, but you will be able to **make giant mends** in order to obtain a drag-free drift in the toughest of water currents. If that isn't enough, having an extended handle will give your **more leverage when fighting powerful fish**.

This is also a great modification for a 9-11wt musky rod allowing you to anchor the extended fighting but into your forearm for increased casting power as well as giving you more leverage when you figure-8 your fly at the end of your cast.

The rod I decided to modify was a 10' 7wt Redington Vice that is my dedicated steelhead rod. The Vice is a fantastic fast-action fly rod that partly due to it's 10' length and durably build blanks can be very tip heavy and can be tiring after a full day of steelheading. Adding a small amount of weight behind the real to **balance out your rod** is another great reason to make this modification.

> **Disclaimer:** Modifying your fly rod will void the warranty of your fly rod. Modify your fly rod at your own risk.

I would not recommend this on a high-end fly rod. Especially if you are planning on sending in your rod for any warranty repair. There is obviously a small amount of risk when modifying your fly rod, Changing the leverage point on a high modulus fly rod can cause the bending point under load to shift causing your rod to break. Modify at your own risk.

If you are aware of the benefits and risks and ready to get started building a more useful fly rod then lets get started!

## What You'll Need

  * Fly Rod
  * 5 minute Epoxy
  * Painters Tape
  * Cork
  * Old Fishing Rod Blank, or small metal rod
  * Sandpaper
  * Utility Knife
  * Drill

## 1: Make the handle

I have an old broken shore fishing rod that I used to create the fighting butt, but you can easily build one from scratch by gluing individual cork rings together topped off with an end cap. If you are using an old rod, your can use a hacksaw to cut the end off the handle.

## 2: Sand the Handle to Shape

You can use a standard drill to sand your handle to shape. Wrap painters tape around a drill bit until it fits snuggly inside the cork.

You get to make the handle fit your hand and your casting style. I made this fighting but 2.25" long and shaped it to be thicker at the end with a slight bulge towards the reel seat.

I prefer to use a coarse 60-100 grit sandpaper to make the initial shape of the handle. Then step down to a 150 for the finishing touches.

You can see the old 3/4" fighting butt that came on my Redington Vice next to the new fishing butt that we are going to put on this rod.

## 3: Remove the Old Fighting Butt

This is the scariest part of the process. Cutting off the old fighting butt. Your rod blank will extend past the reel seat and into the fighting butt. You can either cut the blank off flush, but I prefer to simply cut the old cork away from the blank.

</figure>

You will need an old blank that will be used to extend the blank allowing for a longer handle. You can either use an old unused fishing rod or you can buy a cheap or broken blank at a local rod building supplier. You will want a section that is small enough to fit inside the rod blank, but still has some rigidity.

If your rod blank is too small to fit snuggly you can wrap painters tape around the blank until if fits snuggly into the rods blank.

<figure>
<img title="Mix Two-Part Epoxy" src="/images/Fighting_Butt_8.jpg" alt="">
</figure>

Mix up some two-part epoxy and coat the section of rod blank.

Insert the blank into the end of your rod. Make sure that the new handle will fit over the new extended rod blank and will allow for a flush fit against the reel seat.

Wrap painters tape around new extended blank to build it up in order to fit snuggly into the new fighting butt.

<figure>

</figure>

Mix up another batch of two-part epoxy and coat the new rod blank and painters tape. Slide your new fighting butt onto your rod and apply firm pressure. Epoxy will get pushed out from Between the fighting butt and your reel seat. Make sure you wipe any epoxy off the threads and fighting butt. As an extra precaution you can put painters tape over your reel seat and fighting butt.
