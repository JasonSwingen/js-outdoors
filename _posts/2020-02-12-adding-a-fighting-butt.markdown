Turn your regular fly rod into the ultimate Great Lakes steelheading rod with this simple modification. I've said in my previous posts on steelhead equipment that the perfect fly fishing rod is a 10' 7wt fly rod. This is the perfect weight for our (on average) 20 to 30 inch steelhead, and at 10' you can fish nearly every skinny riffle or wide pool found on the Great Lakes Tributaries.

Adding a fighting butt to your fly rod can greatly improve its versitility and  allow you to easily "switch" (pun intented) to a shooting head system and allow you to make a multitude of two-handed spey casts to throw streamers, as well as give you extra power to through those big double-fly nymph rigs upstream. Not only does having an extra handle help in casting, but you will be able to make giant mends in order to obtain a drag-free drift in the toughest of water currents. If that isn't enough, having an extended handle will greatly help your ability to leverage your fly rod when fighting that steelhead of a lifetime.

The rod I decided to modify was a 10' 7wt Redington Vice that is my dedicated steelhead rod. The Vice is a fantastic fast-action fly rod that partly due to it's 10' length and durably build blanks can be very tip heavy and can be tiring after a full day of steelheading. Adding a small amount of weight behind the real to balance out the rod is another great reason to make this modification.

> **Disclaimer:** This will void the warranty of your fly rod. Modify your fly rod at your own risk.

I would not recommend this on a high-end fly rod. There is a small amount of risk when modifying your fly rod, Changing the leverage point on a high modulus fly rod can cause the bending point under load to shift causing your rod to break.

If you are ready to get started and the benifits outweight the risks for you then lets get started.

## What You'll Need

  * Fly Rod
  * 5 minute Epoxy
  * Painters Tape
  * Cork
  * Old Fishing Rod Blank, or small metal rod
  * Sandpaper
  * Utility Knife
  * Drill

## 1: Make the handle

I han an old broken shore fishing rod that I used to create the fighting butt, but you can easily build one from scratch by gluing indidividual cork rings together topped off with an end cap.
