This is my fourth season in the Duluth City Bowhunt. The last four years I've seen bucks, but either they have not been in range or I had not yet earned-a-buck, which is the policy that you must shoot one antlerless deer in order to shoot a buck. This year I was hoping to change that streak.

I setup two separate stand locations, one where I had seen a doe on two separate occasions and another spot where I had set my trail camera and had a few bucks show up during the summer months.

The first few times I went out hunting, I saw nothing but squirrels and chickadees and was starting to second guess my stand locations. However the trees where still thick with leaves that didn't leave much of a window for viewing. If a deer were to show up it would have to be within 25 yards, which isn't the worst thing since I was well covered and any shot would be a close one.

After waiting for the right wind and weather changes to hopefully stir up some movement I hit the woods with a little higher expectation. Within an hour of getting to my stand I heard what sounded like anters rubbing on branches. I grabbed for my binoculars and started looking for movement through the dense cover.

A nice buck walked slowly through the gabs in the trees and bedded down 40 yards away from me. For the next hour he sat there where I could only see part of his back and his antlers occassionally moving as he bent down to grab for something to chew on. A nice 10 point buck!

Eventually, he got up and started feeding on leaves and was making his way closer. He circled around getting to 25 yards then slowly made his way back and bedded in the exact same spot and position he was before, then just before the sunset a few deer ran behind my stand around 50 yards away. He didn't run after them, but I eventually heard what sounded like antlers in the distance and he took off.

It was extremely hard letting a really nice buck walk within shooting distance, but without shooting a doe first I had to let him pass. It was still amazing to watch him. Even though letting a shooter buck
