When I first started steelheading it was crazy to think that you could tie on a fly or colorful ball of yarn the size of your fingernail, toss it into a muddy fast moving river and somehow catch a steelhead. It took me an entire season struggling to get my first steelhead on the fly and looking back at my flies and the technique I was using, it was no wonder I didn't catch any.

Ever since I caught my first steelhead I have been doing research, talking with local fisherman and trying out new techniques, flies, hooks, weight, rods, and fly lines to find out for myself some of the best tactics to catch Lake Superior steelhead with a fly rod. Hopefully by the end of this article you will either have learned the basics of steelheading on the north shore or if you have been steelheading for a while will have learned a new technique that will allow you to catch more fish during different water conditions.

The main reason for needing an arsenal of steelheading techniques is because the water (especially on the north shore of Lake Superior) is constantly changing. During the early spring season the water will be fast and muddy with all of the snow melting and by the end of the spring season the water will be low, slow, and clear. Fishing the same way in these different conditions will not give you the best presentation in all situations. Below are the types of techniques that will be covered. For each technique I will give information on the type of line you can use, and during what conditions each technique will excel in.

<h2 id="techniques">Steelheading Techniques</h2>

### Nymphing

Out of all the different ways to catch steelhead, nymphing is by far the most common and easiest way to catch a steelhead. However, there are multiple different presentations you can use that allow your nymph to get in the right zone and drift in a natural way. Each one works better in different water depths, flows, and clarity.

#### Chuck-n-Duck

There is nothing elegant about this type of fishing. You add a bunch of weight to your line, add a fly and huck it all upstream. This technique is most beneficial in deep, short runs (very common on the north shore) especially when the water is fast and muddy. However, it is a very versatile technique that you can be used nearly any time of year and in any water condition. Not only does it keep your fly down in the strike-zone longer, but you can fish nearly any water depth without changing any of your rigging, other than adjusting the size or amount of split shot. You can also use this technique to fish from right under your feet to across the river. This technique relies on feeling the bite so you will want to have a fairly light and sensitive rod that will allow you to set the hook when you feel a fish hit.

You can either use almost any type of fly line or monofilament line for this technique. Using Mono will allow you to fish further runs with more sensitivity and less drag, but will not allow you to easily switch to a different technique easily, unless you bring an extra reel or spool with you.
        
The downside to this technique is that it is fairly common to foul hook fish. Snagging fish is not always avoidable, but some anglers use this technique unethically. Try to avoid using this technique if you are sight fishing, and don't set the hook randomly though your drift hoping to snag fish.

##### Three different ways to rig your weight

-   **Drop Shot** _(My first choice)_
    -   Drop Shotting allows you to change the size and amount of split shot easily, change the length and weight of your leader, and because you aren't putting split shot directly on your main line, your won't risk weakening your main line crimping on split-shot. 
    -   **Rigging:** To fish this way you will either need to use a small swivel, tippet ring, or use a line to line knot like the <a href="http://js-outdoors.com/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Blood">blood knot</a>. You can either use straight mono, or tie on a 10-12ft leader of 10-15lb fluorocarbon then attach a swivel or tippet ring. Leave the tag end of your line unclipped and roughly 3-4 inches long. I like to tie a single overhand knot at the end then crimp on my split shot. Then tie on a section of 6-8lb fluorocarbon tippet to the other end of the swivel or tippet ring and attach your favorite fly or egg pattern. You'll want to fish a lighter tippet that your main line so if you do get snagged you don't loose your entire setup, just the last foot or two of your tippet.

-   **Slinky Rig**
    -   The slinky rig is the best way to fish in deep or extra snaggy areas. The You can buy these or make them on your own.
        Minnesota Steelheader has a great guide on how to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/Slinkys.html">build your own slinky rigs</a>.
    -   **Rigging:** This system is rigged and fished very similarly to the drop shot method. But instead having split shot connected directly to your leader, the slinky rig is tied to a swivel can move freely up and down your leader. This method is great if you are tired of getting your split shot snagged, but it is not as versatile as the drop-shot method since you cannot add and remove weight quickly and easily.

-   **In-line Split Shot**
    -   This way of rigging split shot should really only be used as a last resort. It is the easiest way of adding weight to your line, but because you are are crimping directly onto your line and your line will then be running closer to the rocks there is an increased risk of your line becoming damaged. Remember that the pound test line you are using is only as good as strong as its weakest part.
    -   **Rigging:** You can tie your fly directly to your leader or mono line and add split shot 1-3 feet up from your fly.

### Euro Nymphing

Somewhat similar to Chuck-n-Duck fishing, but instead of using split shot to get your nymph or egg pattern to the bottom, you will use a single jig-style tungsten beaded nymph. You can still use split shot if you need to fish really deep, but you need to feel the bite using this technique and split shot will take away the direct connection you have to your fly. I also like using a <a href="http://js-outdoors.com/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Non%20Slip%20Loop">non-slip mono loop knot</a> when tying on a jigged nymph because having a knot that is not cinched down onto the eye will not hinder the natural movement of the fly and allow you to use heavier tippet.

This is an up close and personal technique. To have the best success Euro Nymphing you'll want a long, sensitive rod to feel the bite, but you can also tie in a section of sighter material into your leader. When you toss your fly upstream you will want to keep you rod hight and moving slightly in front of your fly keeping a slight bow in your leader. If you feel a sharp tug or see your leader straighten out then set the hook! This technique is better when the water has started to clear up, but is not so clear that you cannot get close to the water without spooking fish. You can either use straight mono or a long leader with this system as well.

### Indicator Fishing

Horizontal indicator fishing can easily be thought of as putting an indicator on a chuck-n-duck or euro nymphing rig. This allows you to fish further out in pools or runs where you otherwise might not be able to reach. The other benifit to this technique is that indicators are extremely sensitive. It can be difficult especially for a new angler to _feel_ the bite of a fish, but it is pretty easy to tell when you indicator drops.

You can use fly line or mono with this technique as well. Fishing with fly line will allow you to fish further distances, but if the river has a few different speeds of current it can be difficult to get a good drag free drift.

-   **Horizontal**
    -   To make sure your fly is getting all the way to the bottom you should place your indicator one and a half times the depth of the water that you are fishing in. You should see your indicator move slightly as your split shot is ticking the bottom of the rocks. Every once and a while your indicator will stop or drop because it is snagged on a rock or branch, you should set the hook even if you think its a rock just for the odd chance that it is a fish. This technique excels in tailouts (the water at the end of a pool, just before fast water) and when fishing the seams of pools. It is very versatile because you can always take off your indicator and fish the chuch-n-duck method of nymphing without having to re-rig.
-   **Vertical**
    -   Vertical indicator fishing is taking some of the techniques commonly used by centerpin anglers. You use a strike indicator or float, but instead of having all of your weight bunched together and bouncing on the bottom you evenly distribute your split shot down your line between your indicator and fly. This method works best in deep pools and clearer water.

### Streamer Fishing

-   **Swinging Streamers**
    -   Not as common on the north shore as on popular rivers like the Brule River in Wisconsin. You can still use this technique on river mouths and larger north shore rivers. The basics of swinging streamers include casting a fly at roughly a 45 degree downstream angle and letting your streamer "swing" across the river. This is a great technique to cover lots of water as well as catch aggressive steelhead.

-   **Stripping Streamers**
    -   You can use
