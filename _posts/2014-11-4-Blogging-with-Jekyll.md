This is my first post after getting my github pages set up and running with <a target="_blank" href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

## My Workflow

I am currently using Sublime Text 3 to edit my posts. I have only written in HTML before and am currently writing this in __Markdown__, but so far it is a fairly basic transition.

Working on a Windows machine I am limited to GUI apps for compiling SCSS. Even though it is simple to do in the terminal, I find it much faster to pull up __Prepros__ and drop in my current development folder. However, I have to make sure that my md (markdown) files are not compiled into html, which duplicates my posts and doesn't follow in with the look of my current Jekyll layout. What Prepros does that is helpful is it watches my SCSS files and complies them into CSS, which will soon be updated for a new look and feel.

Once I create a post. I simply use __GIT__ to add, commit, and push my post to the master. I have been using the github terminal, but am getting more familiar with their GUI app and will just need to add my commit message, commit, then sync/push to master.

Don't forget about editing your website in the github editor. I prefer using Sublime Text, but if you are ever away from your computer, you can easily edit any of your files straight from your GitHub account.
