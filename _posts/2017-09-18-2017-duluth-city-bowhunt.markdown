Public land whitetail doe down!

After seeing a nice buck this weekend I decided to move to a new area so I didn't risk the chance of bumping him. Threw my climber on my back and walked into the woods. There was not much deer sign, but a few tracks in the mud have me a little motivation. I climbed up a birch tree on a side hill near intersecting trails.

15 minutes after sunset there was some rustling in the brush 30 yards away, then I saw movement through the tall grass. She slowly walked out right onto the trail I was on and looked right up at me. I had my binoculars in hand and froze when she looked up. A few seconds later she lowered her head. I grabbed my bow, drew back, and settled in my 10 yards pin.

I watched as my lighted nock flew through the air. I thought a may have shot a little high, but with such a steep angle I new the exit wound would be about perfect.

After waiting 30 minutes I climbed down and Morgan came to help track it. We looked at the arrow and I was a little worried there was not much blood, but I had payed close attention after the shot and thought I heard a crash not too far away.

We started looking for blood drops, and finally found our first drop 15 yards away. I was getting more worried about the lack of blood we were finding, but not long after we found her! Less than 60 yards from my stand.
