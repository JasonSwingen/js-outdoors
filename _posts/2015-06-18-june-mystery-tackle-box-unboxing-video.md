This is my second Mystery Tackle Box, and my first unboxing. I was very excited about using the Sebile Flat Belly Walker as well as the Batwingz by Z-man. 

## Flat Belly Walker

This bait seemed huge the first time I saw it. It is a great design however. The flat belly makes this thing incredibly easy to walk. The internal weights make it both extremely loud and allow you to cast it a mile. My first cast with this bait caught a 4-5 pound pike within 10 seconds of it hitting the water.

## Punch Jig

Great size and color. It cuts through weeds well. I haven't tested how well it stands up on end.

## Fathead Jr.

I was initially unimpressed with these. Simply because house little they seemed to move. I was using a chatterbait, which may have detracted from allowing the tail to swim. I have bought a few different jig heads to see what works the best.

## Batwingz

These are great. Small Profile with buoyant pinchers that give a good presentation. They are extremely stretchy and will last for bite after bite. Make sure you keep them out of the sun! I was out on a local lake for a few hours and when I returned home I looked through my soft plastics plano box. Every other soft plastic was fine, except the two Batwingz I had in there melted together.

UPDATE - I did a little research after my Z-man Batwingz basically disintegrated, and the elaZtech that is used to make these baits will react to the plasticizer found in other soft plastics and plastic tackle boxes. There is a very faint warning on their packages, but obviously can easily overlooked. I have recently purchased more Z-man elaZtech soft plastics and they are extremely durable, and stretchy. I have learned my lesson about storing Z-man baits.

## Vibragrub

I only used these one time and was unable to catch a fish. I was will try to use with a drop shot set up next time in deeper, less weedy water.

## Wide Gap Worm Hook

Medium small wire hooks will work for a large amount of different presentations. Lightweight texas rigs, carolina rigs, wacky style, or even weightless. 

## Fastach Clip

Great concept. I don't think they are any faster than using a regular clip.
