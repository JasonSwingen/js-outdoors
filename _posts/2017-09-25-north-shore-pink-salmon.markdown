If you are here just to learn about how to catch these fish, you can skip down to section on <a href="#howtopink">How to catch Pink Salmon.</a>

The very first time I heard about pink salmon was last October during the first <a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/GitcheGumeeTU">Gitche Gumee Trout Unlimited</a> meeting of the year. (More specifically what I heard about pink salmon is that they had just finished running and that the north shore rivers were full of them! Notice I said "were". After a year of feeling an opportunity had been missed I was determined to catch this new bucket list fish.

Without ever even seeing a pink salmon before and not much information to go on other than on the north shore of Lake Superior and in September. I took an entire weekend to drive up shore from Duluth towards Grand Marias in search of a hooking my first pink.

My trip started with a very early morning drive up the shore. Early enough to get a few casts from shore into lake superior in search of lake trout and rainbow trout. I spent a beautiful morning casting lil' Cleos into the water while the sun rose behind the clouds and was able to catch a nice kamloop rainbow trout.

After loosing a couple spoons and breaking my brand new Gander Mtn Steelhead rod I was forced to change tactics and species.

I grabbed my 5wt and loaded my pack with nymphs, egg patterns, san juan worms, and streamers and started hiking looking for new water. I fished a few spots on my way and hooked a few small rainbows and medium sized brook trout, but still no pinks.

Then, after a few hours of picking pool after pool apart I walked up to a pool and there they were. Dozens of them.

I spent an hour changing flies trying to get a fish to bite. I eventually hooked into my first pink using a small size 16 copper john style nymph. For there size pink salmon put up a great fight often jumping out of the water like mini steelhead. I spent a little while longer and hooked into a few more, but eventually after sneaking closer and closer I decided to try and get them on video. I left my rod on shore and waded out with my action camera and caught some fantastic footage.

I fished a handful of rivers and ended up finding and catching pinks in each of them. One of my best patterns for pinks ended up being a wooly bugger streamer. I tied my own in pink/black, pink/white, and black/red that all caught fish.

# Late September Update

After a week of rain and taking a break from my the water to sit in my tree stand, I made my way back to the river. It took a little while to find the fish, but once I found them I was catching them one after another. The hens were dropping eggs like crazy so after catching my first fish on a streamer I changed to a small orange egg pattern that matched the eggs.

<h1 id="howtopink">How to catch Pink Salmon</h1>

If you have never caught pink salmon before, don't be intimidated. These fish come into the rivers in large numbers and allow you to make mistakes without blowing out an entire pool. They are also great practice for catching steelhead.


## When
September. Sometimes as early as the middle of August and possibly extending out into October.

Pink Salmon are only supposed to run on even numbered years (e.g. 2014, 2016), but there is currently a run nearly every year.

## Where
The North Shore. Pretty much any river that flows into Lake Superior. From Duluth all the way up the north shore into Canada pink salmon will eventually make a run, usually they start running further north and eventually make there way into the rivers closer to Duluth. It is usually a good idea to work your way from the mouth of the rivers throwing streamers into the outflow and eventually work your way up the river. These fish aren't the best jumpers, so if you get to a decently sized waterfall there is a good chance they haven't made it past that point.

You are not just fishing good looking water like many other species, but are actually looking for the fish themselves. There bright white bellies tend to give them away as they dart around close to the top of the water often towards the tailout of bigger holes. So keep your eyes open and scan for these fish.


## Spinning Gear
You can use spinning gear or fly gear, but most of my advice will be for those using fat lines. If you only have a spinning rod try tying on a small in-line spinner in black, white or pink and swing it in front of them. you can also tie on a yarn glo bug and with an in-line split shot. I would recommend a light action rod in nearly any length and 3 to 6 pound mono our flouro.

## Fly Gear
I have caught pinks on my 3wt, 5wt, and 8wt. Early on in the season they have a tremendous amount more energy than later in the season. Ideally a 3wt, 4wt, or 5wt fly rod would be ideal though.

### Flies
If you have target other species with the fly rod the process is very similar and you can catch them using a large variety of techniques. The most productive flies for me have been small nymphs in size 14 to 20. This includes pheasant tails, copper johns, prince nymphs, and even zebra midges. These seem to work better in slightly slower and clearer water. If you find them in fast dirty water They will often take egg patterns such as small glo bugs and beads in your typical steelhead colors, such as pink, orange, chartreuse, and red. If you aren't getting any bites, or are looking to step up the size of fish you are catching throwing a streamer in front of them especially in the mornings and evenings will likely entice a bigger male to literally take the bait. I tied up a few custom wooly buggers in combinations of red/black, white/pink, and black/pink which seemed to be the best color. You will often see them come up to the surface, but your best bet is to use a weighted streamer, some type of sinking fly line, such as a sink tip, intermediate, or just throw on a poly-leader. If they don't take on the swing don't strip in too fast, but make short erratic pops on your retrieve.

That's it. Time to hit the water! If you have more questions feel free to comment below or message me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jasonswingen/">Instagram</a>
