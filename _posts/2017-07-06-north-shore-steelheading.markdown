It was a great year for steelheading the north shore of Lake Superior. I made a few trips up highway 61 looking for new water to fish. The first trip out the water was high and muddy, but it only took a few casts to hook my first fish. It was just a small rainbow trout and it didn't stay hooked for very long. Working my way down the river I found a small waterfall and fished the pool below it.
