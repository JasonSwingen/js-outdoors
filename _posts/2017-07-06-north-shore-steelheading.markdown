It was a great year for steelheading the north shore of Lake Superior. I made a few trips up highway 61 looking for new water to fish. The first trip out the water was high and muddy, but it only took a few casts to hook my first fish. It was just a small rainbow trout and it didn't stay hooked for very long. Working my way down the river I found a small waterfall and fished the pool below it. I fished that pool for at least an hour then an older fisherman walked down the river and started fishing 10 feet upstream of me in the same pool. Assuming there were no fish in that pocket I figured it was fine if he wanted to fish right were I had been. Before I even made another cast he was hooked up and stumbling his way down stream right through my run. Being new to steelheading, and new to Minnesota fishing in general I assumed there is a different etiquette. After a little frustration wondering how I was unable to hook up with a fish using what looked to be nearly the same setup as the old man I became even more determined. I have fished many times where I didn't catch a fish or even get a bite just to have someone walk up and hook into a steelhead or looper right next to me. I have come to learn that you need to be confident and focused when you target steelhead. Not just midlessly throwing a glo-bug over and over again in one spot expecting something to happen. The size and amount of split shot, the type and size of line your are using, the size and gap of your hook, the right color and size of the fly or egg pattern you are using, as well as the making sure you are getting in front of the fish with a natural drift. I began experimenting with all sorts of different combinations of flies, thinner line, heavier split shot, and within a short amount of time I was hooked up to a giant steelhead!
