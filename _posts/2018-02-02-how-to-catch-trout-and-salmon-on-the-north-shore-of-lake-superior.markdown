Minnesota is full of lakes, rivers, and streams that provide us with a large variety of fishing opportunities. The most sought-after fish for most Minnesota anglers is most likely the walleye, crappies, or bass. Many anglers take long trips to Red, Mille Lacs, Lake of the Woods, Leech Lake, and many other popular lakes looking for fish, but many overlook Lake Superior as a great fishing destination.

I am writing this because after moving to Duluth I spent most of my time figuring out how to catch these common fish species thinking that without taking a boat out on Lake Superior I wouldn't have an opportunity to catch any of the fish that inhabited the big lake.

This article is mainly targeted toward the beginner but has some great tips any shore angler can use. I will break down nearly everything you need to know to get started, including equipment, flies, tackle, where to fish, when to go, and other techniques that help you catch more fish. So, if you want to catch a fish on the north shore of Lake Superior. Well, then you have come to the right place.

</figure>

The best advice I can give you is to get out and put your time in. Try different methods and talk to other <a href="#fishermen">local fishermen</a>. There is not a single way to catch these fish. The best way to catch these fish can depend on the water temperature, water clarity, wind, time of day. So be prepared to change tactics or locations to capitalize on the best bites.

## Species of Fish in Lake Superior

There is a large variety of fish in Lake superior that are catchable from shore. The most popular fish targeted by shore fishermen are Kamloops rainbow trout (looper), and coho salmon. There are also good opportunities to catch steelhead, lake trout, pink salmon, and even lake whitefish. Occasionally brook trout, king salmon, and Atlantic salmon, as well as walleye, and pike can be found as well.

<blockquote>Catching a trout or salmon from shore, especially Lake Superior's shore, is one of those experiences that I believe every fisherman should have.</blockquote>

## Know the Regulations

This article would be way too long and boring to read if I included all the regulations you need to know about trout and salmon fishing, so I will just list a few that you absolutely need to know before hitting the shore.

<ul>
    <li>You will need a trout stamp - <a target="_blank" href="http://licenses.dnr.state.mn.us/">MNDNR Licenses</a></li>
    <div class="image-right">
        <img src="/images/clippedSteelhead.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <li>You should know the difference between <br>a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/Kamloops.html">Kamloops rainbow trout</a> (with a clipped adipose fin) that you <b>can keep</b> and <br>a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/Steelhead.html">wild steelhead</a> (with an intact adipose fin) that you <b>must release</b>.</li>
    <li>If you are going to keep fish, know the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fishmn/regs.html">current fishing regulations</a> for size and quantity. <i>Below are the current limits for 2017, you must check the current fishing regulations for updated limits.</i></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Kamloops Rainbow trout - 3 with a minimum size limit of 16". Total allowed number of brook trout, splake, brown trout and rainbow trout is 5.</li>
            <li>Lake Trout - 3</li>
            <li>Salmon (Chinook, Coho, Pink, Atlantic) - 5 combined (only one can be Atlantic salmon). Minimum size 10".</li>

        </ul>
</ul>

### Steelhead vs Kamloops

If you want to learn more about the difference between Kamloops rainbow trout and "wild" steelhead as well as some of the history, you should read this great article by local fisherman Leif Birnbaum - <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bigkype.com/2012/04/the-stocked-rainbow-trout-in-minnesota-waters-of-lake-superior/">The Stocked Rainbow Trout In Minnesota Waters Of Lake Superior</a>

#### Interbreeding Between Steelhead and Kamloops rainbow trout.

The MN DNR has been conducting a study on the hybridization between steelhead and Kamloops rainbow trout for years trying to determine if these two species of rainbow trout are interbreeding. It has recently been found to be true and because the offspring of these hybrid fish are found not to survive as well as the pure steelhead strain of rainbow trout, the French River Hatchery that has been stocking Kamloops into Lake Superior will be closing. If you would like to learn more, there are many great articles about the <a target="_target" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/SGP.html">Steelhead Genetics Project</a>, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/sports/outdoors/4243375-study-steelhead-kamloops-rainbows-interbreeding-north-shore">Interbreeding of steelhead and Kamloops</a>, as well as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/SGP/Final_updated%20Fact%20Sheet%20Steelhead%20Genetics%20Project.pdf">MNDNR Rainbow Trout Genetics and Future Management Plan (pdf)</a> and <a target="_target" href="http://www.kamloopsadvocates.org/uploads/1/6/4/0/16405852/lake_superior_advisory_group_steelhead_genetics_project_year_1__update.pdf">Steelhead Genetics Project: Year-1 Update (pdf)</a>.  

## Equipment

Alright, now that we are done with all of <i>that</i> we can get into the really fun stuff. And by fun stuff, I mean buying some fishing gear!

If you live close to Lake Superior and are looking to get into shore fishing or you want to make a trip of fishing the north shore you can easily start out without buying too much more gear than you probably already have. You can use nearly any regular bass or walleye rod and get into fish. However, if you want to increase your chances of catching a fish, or plan on fishing the shore more than a few times it is a good idea to start with a dedicated shore rod. The biggest difference between a shore rod and your typical fishing rod is the length. Having a long rod will allow you to cast further and get better hooksets.

### Buying your first shore rod
Just like bass fishing, there are different types of rods that work better for different techniques. Heavy, fast action rods that will allow you to use jigs to punch through and pull fish out of thick cover. Shorter, moderate action rods that will allow you to walk a topwater and keep a fish pinned on lures with treble hooks. There are also different techniques of shore fishing that ideally take a different rod, although there are jack-of-all-trade rods that will do all of them fairly well.

<blockquote>If I had one shore rod that I could use for any type of fishing it would be a medium power, moderate fast action, 10 to 12-foot rod.</blockquote>

You can get cheap rods that will work fine, although you should make sure that any rod you buy has regular/large guides. Most of the shore fishing opportunities occur when the temperatures are near or below zero. If you guides are too small ice build-up on your line and guides will cause your fishing line to stick and possibly break.

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IDEO7KI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01IDEO7KI&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors-20&linkId=47b460acaefe2709fc7b4a658d960ec7"><img class="image-right" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B01IDEO7KI&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jsoutdoors-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01IDEO7KI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important; " />

Another option shore rods have it grip design. This isn't a huge factor, but typically if you spend more time casting it is better to have a rod with a longer rear grip and short foregrip. If you spend more time bobber fishing you will want a rod with a longer foregrip. This will allow you to balance the rod horizontally so you are able to make a quick hookset when your bobber goes down.

I am currently using a <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2DL30c9">Fenwick HMX Salmon/Steelhead rod</a>. It is a 10.5' medium auction, moderate-fast action rod that can be used for a variety of different applications, but it is most often rigged with a casting bobber and a looper bug or fly.

There are many great shore rods built by <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2GxdNZd">St Croix</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2rURMQO">G Loomis</a>, that can are expensive, but you often get what you pay for. If you are looking in the custom market there is no better rod builder in the Duluth area that <a target="_blank" href="https://www.damgoodsandgear.com/">Dam Goods and Gear</a>. They make custom ice, fly-fishing, walleye, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.damgoodsandgear.com/product-page/steelie-99-mono-rod">steelhead rods</a>.

## Reels

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LDYJN3C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00LDYJN3C&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors-20&linkId=c0c9a4e1b0ed6e52c4118962bb0d70cc"><img class="image-right" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B00LDYJN3C&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jsoutdoors-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B00LDYJN3C" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Reels with a big arbor, a large amount of line capacity, and a smooth drag work the best for fishing. You can get away with any 200 size spinning reel, but the larger 300 to 400 sizes are ideal. Typically larger reels are cheaper and have a better drag, so you can typically find inexpensive reels that are very high in quality for as low as $30. Like the <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2E1t468">Shimano Sienna</a>. I am currently using a <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2EqLhIc">Daiwa Exceler 3500H</a> and it has never let me down.

## Line, Flies, Bugs, and Other Tackle

### Line

You can use whatever line you want, but the majority of shore fisherman choose 4-10 lb monofilament. 90% of the time I use 6 lb mono and it works for nearly all applications. My personal favorite is <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2GzrMOs">Maxima Ultragreen</a>. Mono is cheap, it floats (which is ideal for bobber fishing, and has enough stretch to soften some of the violent head shakes and rolls of the bigger fish you will be catching. Tying on a swivel and fluorocarbon leader can also be a good idea especially with the water is extremely clear.

### Bobber Fishing

<a target="_blank" href="http://www.marinegeneral.com/productdetails.asp?productid=1635417"><img class="image-right" src="/images/castingbobber.png" alt=""></a>
Bobber fishing is one of the most common ways to catch salmon and steelhead from shore. These heavily weighted bobbers allow you to launch your fly out to where the fish are feeding. These bobbers come in 3-4 different sizes. You may have to buy a couple different sizes to see what ones match up with your rod the best. You need to have a combination of the smallest bobber you are able to cast, as well as see way out in the often wavy waters. Black bobbers are typically the easiest to see, but if there are a bunch of other fishermen near you, it can be helpful to have a different color so you can pick out your bobber from your neighbors.

<figure>
  <img title="Fisherman at the French River" src="/images/FrenchRiverFishing.jpg">
  <figcaption>The shore can be a busy place during certain times of the year.</figcaption>
</figure>

Rigging for bobber fishing is fairly simple, just peg your casting bobber onto your line and tie on a fly or looper bug two to four feet below. I typically use either an <a href="/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Improved Clinch">improved clinch knot</a>, or a <a href="/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/#Non Slip Loop">no-slip mono loop knot</a>, but you can always find your favorite knot in my <a href="/fishing/What-Knot-To-Know/">What Knot to Know</a> guide.


#### Looper Bugs

<a href="/images/looperbugs.jpg"><img style="width:150px;" class="image-right" src="/images/looperbugs.jpg" alt=""></a>

Looper Bugs are a great fly to use when fishing for Coho Salmon and Kamloops (looper) rainbow trout and steelhead on the North Shore of Lake Superior. They are very easy to tie, all you only need a jig hook and four different materials. If you can tie a wooly bugger, you can tie a looper bug. They can be tied in a variety of different jig sizes (1/8 to 1/64 oz). Just make sure that the hook is a premium heavy gauge hook. You can also tie these in nearly any color combination. As you can see I prefer darker colors including black, brown, and purple, especially in muddy or wavy water. Although you shouldn't overlook white, pink, and green.

If you don't tie your own flies don't worry these bugs can be found in most of the local shops in Duluth including <a target="_blank" href="http://fishermanscorner.net/">Fisherman's Corner</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.marinegeneral.com/">Marine General</a>

<blockquote>Loopers will often take a bare bug, but if you are trying to catch coho it is best to tip your hook with some meat. Like a waxworm or butterworm.</blockquote>

#### Traditional Flies

If you fly fish or tie flies many of these flies can be used fishing from shore as well. Stoneflies and nymphs, including the prince nymph and pheasant tail nymph are go-to flies in almost any body of water, including lake superior. These flies tied anywhere from size 6 to 16 can produce fish. In some cases going all the way down to a size 20 or smaller can be the only way to get a bite.

### Casting Spoons

<a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUUPQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0000AUUPQ&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors-20&linkId=dab27ae7b91c64484573625daa586241"><img class="image-right" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=B0000AUUPQ&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=jsoutdoors-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0000AUUPQ" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
The first fish I caught from shore was with casting spoon. I love catching fish casting spoons because you get to feel the take and casting can be a little more entertaining than staring at your rod or waiting for a bobber to go down. The biggest downfall of casting spoons is that <i>you - will - lose - them</i>, and why they are not extremely expensive (on average $5 a piece) the costs will add up if you primarily throw spoons. If you let your spoon fall all the way to the bottom you might as well have just untied it and thrown it in the water.

With all that said, spoons can be extremely productive and when the fish are actively feeding. Some of the most popular spoons are <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2rVd1SR">Kastmasters</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2FxeTTQ">Lil Cleos</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2GtftmG">Krocodiles</a>. My favorite spoon is a 2/5 oz orange and gold Lil Cleo, but blue and silver is often a better choice in clear water situations. Depending on the power of your rod you will want to get spoons from 1/4 oz up to 3/4 oz. I believe Lil Cleos have the best action, but if you need to get more distance there is no beating a Kastmaster, especially with the wind in your face.

Trout and salmon typically like to chase and are natural predators. Once you cast, wait a couple seconds for your spoon to drop in the water column, then a fairly quick and constant retrieve is often the best way to get a bite.

### Bottom Rigging

#### Slinky Rig

You can use a standard sinker when fishing from shore but while you're at local fishing store re-stocking all the spoons you lost, you might as well pick up a few dozen sinkers. Or, you can use the slinky rig - a sinker built out of parachute cord and split-shot. You can either buy them from local fishing stores like Marine General or you can make your own slinky rigs. Kamloops advocates have good instructions on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kamloopsadvocates.org/the-slinky.html">building a slinky rig</a>.

##### Rigging
You will want to slip your main line through the swivel of the slinky rig then tie on another swivel, leader, and hook. This will allow a fish to run and gives you a direct connection to the fish without the fish feeling the weight of the slinky rig. After you make your cast, place your rod in a rod holder (which can easily be built by duct taping PVC pipe to a metal rod). After your weight sinks to the bottom slowly reel in the slack until your rod begins to bend. Make sure your drag isn't so tight a fish will pull your rod into the water, but not so loose that you can't detect a bite or get a good hookset.

#### Spawn

<div class="image-right">
  <a href="/images/spawn.jpg"><img style="width:250px;" title="rainbow trout spawn" src="/images/spawn.jpg" alt="rainbow trout spawn"></a>
</div>

You can buy spawn, but if you catch and keep a female looper you can, <i>and should</i> cure the eggs and make your own spawn sacks. There are many ways to cure eggs, Here is a video from the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/yPsryzBUUpk">Consummate Sportsman on how to use borax to cure eggs</a> as well as a video from <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Vki31kS9Hck">Pautzke Bait on how to tie spawn sacks</a>. If you do catch a hen (female) looper and aren't planning on using the eggs, see if any other fisherman could use them.


#### Worms

You can fish with worms just like you would fish with spawn. Although, You will need to get the worm to float to get it off the bottom. You can do this by either buying a worm blower and adding air into the worm, or you can add a small float just below your hook.

<blockquote>When rigging your bottom rigs remember that catching bigger fish doesn't correlate with having a bigger hook. Trout are notoriously picky and having a giant hook can and will deter fish, so using small hooks (size 2-8) with spawn sacks, or worms can increase your catch rate significantly.</blockquote>

## Miscellaneous Equipment

Here is a list of other items that may be helpful when fishing the north shore.

<ul>
  <li>Headlamp</li>
  <li>Warm Clothes (some of the best fishing occurs on cold winter mornings.)</li>
  <li>Rod Holders (for bottom rigging)</li>
  <li>Ice Cleats </li>
  <li>Waterproof boots</li>
  <li>Sunglasses</li>
  <li>Long-Handled Net</li>
  <li>Pliers - Buy a pair of <a target="_blank" href="http://amzn.to/2rSKBc5">Scissor Mitten Clamps</a>, you won't regret it.</li>
</ul>

## Where to Fish

If you can get down to the shore and it is public water, throw a line in! There are opportunities to fish all the way from the Canal Park lighthouse all the way up the shore into Canada. Some of the best areas to fish are in close proximity to river mouths. Many fishermen prefer to fish at the French river, but there can be equal or better fishing at many other areas up and down the shore. Especially with the recent closing of the French River Hatchery.

## When to Go

There aren't many times when you can't catch fish on the north shore. Although there are a few times of the year that can be better than others.

### Fall

From my own personal experience, I have found that the fall is one a great time to catch rainbow trout and lake trout. The fish seem to be more active and eager to chase. This is the time of year when I am most often throwing spoons.

<figure>

  <figcaption><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bendo.elfelt?ref=br_rs">Ben Elfelt</a> with at Lake Superior Looper</figcaption>
</figure>

Early fall is also a great time to catch pink salmon. I recently wrote an article on <a href="/fishing/north-shore-pink-salmon/">how to catch pink salmon</a> during their fall run.

<figure>
  <img title="Pink Salmon" src="/images/Pink_Salmon.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Pink Salmon. Often referred to as "humpies"</figcaption>
</figure>

### Winter
Once winter hits you can still catch fish on spoons, but casting bobbers with looper bugs will usually produce the most fish. If the water is muddy or the waves are high I tie on a large black or purple looper bug. If the water is clear and calm I will downsize to a Superior X-legs or a similar stonefly. Loopers and Coho are the biggest targets in the middle of winter.

</figure>

### Through the Ice
There is a possibility that Lake Superior will freeze in the winter. If it does, catching lake trout and coho through the ice can be some of the most exciting fishing you will ever do. If you want to <a href="/fishing/lake-trout-ice-fishing-lake-superior/">learn how to catch lake trout through the ice</a> or you can watch a <a href="http://www.js-outdoors.com/fishing/ice-fishing-for-lake-trout-video/">video of ice fishing for lake trout</a>.

</figure>

### Spring

Once the rivers start to melt, trout begin staging at river mouths waiting to spawn. This can be a fantastic time to fish and they can be caught using almost any method listed above. With spawn and smaller flies tied under casting bobbers being the most popular. Once the rivers open up the best fishing follow the fish up the rivers.
