My friend Ben came up to try our hand at trolling for Lake Superior Coho Salmon. After checking the weather to find a day that we would be able to get the boat out we finally made it out on the big lake. We tried to get the kinks out on Saturday night so we would be able to hit the water hard on Sunday morning. Unfortunately, once we got to the harbor and put the boat in we starting having some engine problems. Fortunately, there was another fisherman getting his boat launched and ready. He first offered to give us his number incase we ran into more trouble, but since two of his friends were unable to make it he offered to take us on his boat.

I consider myself a decent fisherman, but I felt like an amateur listening to these guys talk about fishing. If not just for the experience on the water, it was worth it just to hear the reasoning behind what, when, why, and how to fish on the big lake.

We set up 8 lines and trolling around looking for coho, kings, steelhead, or lake trout.
