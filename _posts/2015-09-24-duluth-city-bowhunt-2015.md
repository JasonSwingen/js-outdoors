Last year was a slow year for bowhunting for me. I hunted a few sections public land south of Duluth, and only saw a few deer a couple of the times I went out. The only antlers I saw were on a little fork-horn on the last day of the season that didn't get any closer than 100 yards away.

## Apply To Hunt With The Arrowhead Bowhunters Alliance

This year will hopefully be different. I completed all of the requirements for the [Arrowhead Bowhunters Alliance](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/), and was able to go to the lottery. If you are looking to enter in the Duluth City Hunt, it is a good idea to get started early in the spring to get all of the requirements completed. Below is a list of requirements that you need to complete in order to be entered into the hunt.




1. Complete an approved [Bowhunter Education Course](http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/safety/bowhunter/index.html).
2. Pass a [shooting proficiency test](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/proficiency-test).
3. Register at [www.bowhuntersalliance.org](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/).
4. Complete the [Bowhunters Alliance Online Application](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/edit-profile?view=login).
5. Write a $25.00 check or money order made payable to the City of Duluth.
6. Complete [Part 2 of the application (pdf)](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/downloads/2015%20Application%20Part%202.pdf).
7. Send in your application.

If there are more hunters than spots available there will be a lottery. This year there were 383 total applicants (285 were returning hunters and 97 were new). 369 of the hunters have been placed in a DHA.

As a new hunter I was unable to get my first or second choices in DHA. I was able to get a spot in [DHA 2A](http://www.bowhuntersalliance.org/images/dha_maps/DHA2.jpg), which mainly covers the Magney-Snively Natural Area.

### August 14th 2015 - Trail Camera Trip

Things are looking good. I put out my trail camera during the middle of the day and that night captured pictures of a doe.

### August 21st 2015 - Trail Camera Trip

The area has a few possible trails though it so I moved my camera to show a different angle.

### September 22nd 2015 - First Day in the Stand

![View From Treestand](/images/From_Treestand.jpg)

I made a trip earlier in the week to get my stand set up and shooting lanes cut. That way I knew I would be ready to go on my first hunt.

I set my alarm for 4 a.m. but my excitement had me up by quarter to. I got out to to my spot and was up in my stand an hour and a half before sunrise. I had just strapped my climber to the tree and heard some rustling behind me. I still had my headlamp on, but quickly shut it off and held still. It was so dark I was unable to see what it was. It sounded like a deer and it walked directly under my stand. That was the only action I got that morning. I left my stand and mid morning so I would be ready for a full evening hunt. Unfortunately, nothing came by in the evening either.

### October 4th 2015 - First Deer Sighting

On Saturday, October 3rd I decided to move my stand. Just a week I had moved it around 100 yards away from my original spot earlier in the week as I had seen some fresh deer sign on my way to my stand. There was a new spot I can checked out and was planning on moving my stand there, but after checking my stand I realized a doe had been right where my original stand was placed just a few hours before I got there, as well as the two days prior. So, back to my first location I went.

Just a few minutes before sunrise, I heard crunch crunch... crunch crunch. This was it. I new there were deer coming my way. There are two main trails coming into the opening I was set up in that would funnel them either directly under me or 20 yards away. The deer just kept on walking by and ended up walking up a hill on the back side of my stand. I could see the doe and later a fawn. The only shot I would have had was a 35 yard, facing away shot through a 6 inch window of branches.

### November 3rd 2015 - Not the animal I want to see

I decided to hunt a quick afternoon and got everything ready and headed out to my stand. There was a white car parked next to where I normally do that didn't look like a hunters car, but I figured that wouldn't be a problem as I'm headed off the trail. After less than and hour of getting into my stand, I hear movement to my right! Unfortunatly the driver of the car and her dog decided to take a walk off the trail, right next to my stand. Her dog never saw me but about 25 yards away it was barking up a different tree, most likely smelling the buck bomb I had just sprayed a half hour before. Hunt over.

### It's already November! - Good News and Bad News

So it's finally November and the deer are just starting to get into the rut. This is prime time and I need to get out in the stand as soon as possible.

As I drove out to check my trail camera I was greeted with a three cement barriers with a sign that read "road closed". There is only one road that passes through the Magney-Snively area and it is now closed on both ends of the land I'm able to hunt...

I'm not done yet, I just need to figure out how to get back into the field.

### No Deer

Well I wasn't able to get it done this year. I moved to a few different spots and had deer of camera, but just wasn't getting anything to consistently come in.
