My last opportunity to ice fish for lake trout this year. The weather has taken a huge turn and spring decided to come with little warning. There was still 12 inches of ice on the lake, but there were many massive cracks that made getting out onto the lake slightly more difficult.

I was fishing off of Brighton Beach on the Northeast end of Duluth MN in 120 feet of water. I was using a white tube jig that I tied my own stinger hook onto. This fish came right off the bottom.
