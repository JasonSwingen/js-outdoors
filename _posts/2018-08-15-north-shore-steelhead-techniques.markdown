When I first started steelheading it was crazy to think that you could tie on a fly or colorful ball of yarn the size of your fingernail, toss it into a muddy fast moving river and somehow catch a steelhead. It took me an entire season struggling to get my first steelhead on the fly and looking back it was no wonder I wasn't catching any. Ever since my first steelhead I have been trying many different techniques and experimenting with different flies, hooks, weight, fly line, and more to get a better understanding of the best equipment and techniques to use.

<h2 id="techniques">Steelheading Techniques</h2>

There are many ways to catch steelhead, but to catch north shore steelhead the most common method is nymphing. However, there are multiple different presentations you can use that allow your nymph to get in the right zone and drift in a natural way.

-   **Nymphing**
    -   **Chuck-n-Duck**
        -   When to use this technique - It is most beneficial in deep, short runs (very common on the north shore) especially when the water is fast and muddy. However, it is a very versatile technique that you can use during the entire run. Not only does it keep your fly down in the strike-zone longer, but you can fish nearly any run or pool without changing any of your rigging, other than adjusting the size or amount of split shot.
        -   **Three different ways of rigging your split shot**
            -   **Drop Shot** _(My personal favorite)_
                -   It allows you to change the size and amount of split shot easily, change the length and weight of your leader, and because you aren't putting split shot directly on your main line, your line will last longer.
            -   **Slinky Rig**
                -   The slinky rig is the best way to fish deep often snaggy areas. The You can buy these or make them on your own.
                    Minnesota Steelheader has a great guide on how to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.minnesotasteelheader.com/Slinkys.html">build your own slinky rigs</a>.
            -   **In-line Split Shot**
    -   **Euro Nymphing**
        -   Similar to Chuck-n-Duck fishing. Instead of using split shot to get your nymph or egg pattern to the bottom, you will use a single jig-style tungsten beaded nymph.
        -   When to use this technique -
    -   **Indicator**
        -   **Horizontal**
            -   Horizontal indicator fishing can easily be thought of as putting an indicator on a chuck-n-duck or euro nymphing rig. This allows you to fish further out in pools or runs where you otherwise might not be able to reach.
            -   When to use this technique -
        -   **Vertical**
            -   Vertical indicator fishing is taking some of the techniques commonly used by centerpin anglers.
            -   When to use this technique -
            -   strike indicator - series of small split shot spaced equily - nymph/egg pattern
                -   _I learned this technique during GGTU State of the Steelhead meeting. Brent Notbohm often uses this technique it mostly on the Bois Brule river in Wisconsin, but works well in most larger slower waters._
-   _Streamers_

    -   Swinging Streamers

        -   Not as common on the north shore as on popular rivers like the Brule River in Wisconsin. You can still use this technique on river mouths and larger north shore rivers.
            The basics of swinging streamers include casting a fly at roughly a 45 degree downstream angle and letting your streamer "swing" across the river. This is a great technique to cover lots of water as well as catch aggressive steelhead.

    -   Stripping Streamers
