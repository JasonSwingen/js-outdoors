So you have decided <a href="#">swinging is right for you</a>, and you figured out <a href="#">the gear you need to start swinging</a>. Next you will need to learn a how to cast your fly in order to get it in front of a steelhead or other migratory fish.

I could get into the weeds about where spey casting originated from (the River Spey in Scotland), and why it was invented (allowing long casts while avoiding obstacles on the shore), but instead I am going to explain the types of casts you can use and why you should use them.

Like I have mentioned in my earlier articles on swinging flies, Spey casting is an extremely efficient way to present your fly to a fish on rivers with minimal room for a backcast. Some of these casts can be used when nymphing as well, so if you indicator fish for steelhead, then spey casting will be beneficial for you as well.

## Spey Casting Basics

Spey casting may seem like some overcomplicated way to cast a fly, especially when you first see it done, and once you learn how many types of spey casts there are. To try and simplify spey casting I like to break it down into different parts. First the setup, and second the roll cast. Since spey casting is basically a roll cast that involves at least one extra step in order to relocate your fly to a specific spot in the water that will allow you to roll cast effectively.

The reason there are so many different kinds of casts are because of a few different factors. The direction the water is flowing. The directions the wind is blowing, and the direction or angle you are trying to cast your fly. This was one of the most confusing parts for me when learning spey casting. Each cast can be performed on river-left, river-right, right hand on top, or left hand on top. It will be much easier to learn these casts if you stick with the same direction of water flow and with your dominant hand on top (at least for now)

Spey casting isn't some magical thing, and really shouldn't be overcomplicated.



## Where to Swing
Now that you have everything you need to swing you probably want to know where to start. No I'm not going to tell you specific spots, but I'll go through some general areas that are better to swing a fly. Unlike Nymphing where you would generally work your way up-river, swinging flies requires you to work your way down-river.

### The Casts:

- Single Spey
- Double Spey
- Snap T
- Perry Poke
- Rewind Cast
- Snake Roll
- Jelly Roll



#### Casts to learn first
For 95% of situations I think you could get away with just knowing the *double spey* and *snap T* casts, but eventually you will want to have a full arsenal of casts in order to cover water in any condition.

#### The Setup



You can use these casts with
If you are right-handed you should hold your

#### Single Spey
The single spey is one of the easiest casts to wrap your head around as it involves the least amount of steps and closely resembles a standard roll cast, but it can also take some practice to master. Because of it's simplicity It is one of the quickest ways to get your fly back in the water.

#### Double Spey

#### Snap-T
Snap C, Circle C

#### Perry Poke

#### Rewind Cast

#### Snake Roll

#### Jelly Roll

Do you want to learn the most effective techniques used to catch steelhead on the fly? This article will cover all of the **most popular fly fishing techniques** as well as the **best conditions to use each one**. It mainly covers tributaries on the north shore of Lake Superior, but also rivers like the Brule in Wisconsin, and many other Great Lakes Tributaries. By the end of this article you will have learned the following:

-   Multiple nymphing and swinging techniques.
-   How to rig your flies for each technique.
-   How to choose which technique to use for different water conditions.
-   A few tips to make you more efficient on the water.

### Swinging Streamers

The basics of swinging streamers include casting a fly at roughly a 45-degree downstream angle and letting your streamer "swing" across the river. This is a great technique to cover lots of water as well as catch aggressive steelhead.

Streamers are often swung with the use of a specific type of two-handed (switch or spey) rod and a (shooting head) fly line that allows you to cast weighted flies across larger rivers

**You can easily switch to this technique from a running line nymphing setup**. Just remove your leader and add a shooting head, sink tip and tippet.

-   **Rigging:** There are endless options for fly lines to use when swinging streamers. The most common setup is backing, shooting line (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ulomKg">30-40lb Lazer Line</a>), a shooting head (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2U5lcZq">OPST Commando Head</a>), a sink tip (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ycqq4V">RIO Mow tips</a>), and a level tippet (usually fluorocarbon) in 10-15 lbs and roughly 4ft long. You'll want a heavier tippet since fish will often strike a streamer extremely aggressively.

### Stripping Streamers

This type of streamer fishing could almost be combined with swinging streamers. At the end of your swing, you should always strip your fly back to you since a fish may have seen your fly and is waiting to strike. However, you can also strip streamers without swinging them first. Especially in slack water and deep pools.

You can use a two hand (switch rod) for this, but your standard 7-8wt 9-10ft fly rod is ideal. The smaller tributaries found on the north shore will allow you to use a standard weight forward line or a sink tip line. If you only have a floating line and want to fish deeper sections or pools I would highly recommend buying a few assorted <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TpTvpY">PolyLeaders</a>. These replace your nylon leader with one that essentially turns your floating line into a sink tip. You can easily switch to this technique from a (fly line) nymphing setup.

-   **Rigging:** Any weight forward fly line will work, although I prefer floating lines since you can always use heavier flies or add on a PolyLeader to get deeper, it is not as easy to fish full sinking and sink tip lines in shallow riffles and runs. Just like swinging streamers, you will want to use 3-4ft of a heavier tippet (10-15lb) since fish will often strike a streamer extremely aggressively!
