I have since had many people ask me about how to fish for steelhead on the north shore of Lake Superior. So I'm going to answer the most common questions by going over the  <a href="#equipment">equipment you need to get start steelheading</a>. If you already have the gear you need then feel free to skip down to the different <a href="#techniques">techniques</a>, and some <a href="#protips">pro tips</a> that can be used to cover water the most effectively. This article is not intended to be a complete summary of everything that you can use to catch a steelhead. You can also catch steelhead on streamers, dry flies, Rapalas, spinners, and all sorts of different baits and using different techniques. What this article is going to do is cover some of the most commonly used methods as well as teach you a few tips on adapting to conditions to cover more water and catch more fish! If you are still looking for more information by the end of this article I have included some <a href="#resources">great local resources</a>.

<h2 id="equipment">Steelheading Equipment</h2>

-   **Rod**

    -   A 9' 8wt fly rod is the versatile rod for steelheading. It is long enough to allow for mends, short enough to fish smaller sections of rivers, and has enough backbone to fight even the biggest north shore steelhead. A 9' 8wt is also an ideal rod for fly fishing for bass and pike! If you only fish for steelhead and want to fish larger rivers like the Bois Brule River in WI, or some of the larger rivers near Grand Marais a 10ft rod may be a better option.
    -   You don't necessarily need an expensive rod for steelheading. Since you are typically fishing in smaller waters and don't need to rely on delicate, highly accurate casts. A more expensive rod will have higher quality components, will often be lighter, and often a better warranty. I have used a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LYYDFVP/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01LYYDFVP&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=7f7aa37493889e4c0729210db82f47d0">Maxcatch Extreme Fly Rod (9ft 8weight)</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01LYYDFVP" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> for a few years and is hasn't let me down, and at only $50 it's a steal! You can also by it as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Maxcatch-Extreme-Fishing-weight-Outfit/dp/B01N0SH97L/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&qid=1530018358&sr=8-10&keywords=fly+rod+combo+8wt&linkCode=ll1&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=7f0f99a1f633177f4b88a18b14ab5d29">combo</a>. If you are looking for something a little nicer, take a look at fly rods like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003539CW6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B003539CW6&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=1fb7975f4e5bc4255440409bb8549db8">St. Croix Rio Santo</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B003539CW6" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, or the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J8X9ZNW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01J8X9ZNW&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=7af923e15343a6e5a7487ac77f990d49">Redington Vice</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01J8X9ZNW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If you are looking to get one of the best rods available it is hard to beat the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWTLQJT/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01LWTLQJT&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=fd1ee925fa322a5a9fb7d31889c46bde">Sage X </a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01LWTLQJT" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. If you are near Duluth the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greatlakesflyfish.com/">Great Lakes Fly Shop</a> currently has some great rods from Echo and Scott.
    -   I have recently been using a 11' 7wt switch rod and have found it to be extremely adaptable. Switch rods can be a little unwieldy in smaller sections of the north shore, however it allows you to reach sections of water that you just can fish effectively with a 9ft rod.
    -   Most anglers user a fly rod to catch steelhead, but you only have a spinning rod, or even a baitcasting rod, you can use many of the same techniques and fish for steelhead.

-   **Reel**

    -   Pair your reel to your rod. Most fly reels come in a 5/6, 7/8, or 9/10 size corresponding to the line size they hold. 7/8 reels are the most common depending on the size of fly line you are using.
    -   Make sure it has a good drag system. Steelhead will rip line from your reel and can sometime get caught in the current and you'll have no choice but to chase them down. Use the money you saved on a rod to buy a nice reel. I have been using a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013VO82HO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B013VO82HO&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=c8e7555dc1b1e600b698180137805165">Redington Behemoth 7/8 Reel</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B013VO82HO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> and it is a fantastic reel, offering a large arbor and extremely smooth drag with a large drag dial. A few other good options are the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A9GKOMI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01A9GKOMI&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=7cd115861811db18da73ca5e795afcab">Allen Kraken</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01A9GKOMI" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, and if you want to change spools with different fly line, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0113GVHCO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0113GVHCO&linkCode=as2&tag=jsoutdoors08-20&linkId=0aee8d315a6a3bfd3e6cf8209af61e5b">Waterworks Lamson Liquid</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=jsoutdoors08-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0113GVHCO" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is a great option because it comes with two extra spools.

-   **Line**

    -   Some anglers prefer to use fly line, while other prefer mono. Both have their pros and cons, and excel in different situations. It is a good idea to one spool with fly line and another with mono so you can switch between techniques easily depending on water conditions.
        -   **Fly line**
            -   Weight forward floating line. Paired up to or slightly over-lined to your rod. (I like to use 9 or 10wt fly line on my 8wt fly rod to turn over heavy indicator setups)
            -   You will also need backing when using fly line. 20 to 30 lb is ideal. Although, Steelhead likely won't take you to your backing, it is good to have it for peace of mind.
            -   Leader: 6-9ft 0-3x tapered nylon leaders work great for many different applications. I often build my own leaders for steelheading that consist of 6ft of 20lb mono and 3ft of 15lb flouro. I tie on a small barrel swivel or tippet ring then tie on tippet depending on water depth and clarity.
            -   Tippet: 2-3ft of 2-4x (6-10lb) fluorocarbon.
        -   **Mono line**
            -   Many north shore anglers skip the fly line altogether and use straight 6-10lb monofilament. (Higher abrasion resistance and visibility lines are best). There are pros and cons to using straight mono. Mono is harder to handle with gloves or cold fingers, but it is ideal when fishing fast deep water. You can either fish straight mono to your hook, or use a flourocarbon leader. I will go over different ways to rig these lines in the <a href="#techniques">techniques</a> section below.

-   **Flies**

    -   **Egg Patterns**
        -   Yarn flies are cheap, easy to tie, and a proven steelhead catcher.
        -   Beads are growing in popularity tend to work better is slower clearer water conditions.
    -   **Nymphs / Stoneflies** _in sizes 6 to 12_
        -   Pheasant tail
        -   Hare's Ear
        -   Frenchie
        -   Copper John
        -   Pink Squirrel
        -   Hairy Ass Stone
        -   Superior X-Legs
        -   Egg Sucking Leech
        -   Egg Sucking Stone
        -   Kauffman's Stone
    -   _Note: You can only use one fly on the North Shore of Lake Superior._

-   **Fishing License / Trout Stamp**

    -   You'll need a regular <a target="_blank" href="http://licenses.dnr.state.mn.us/">MN Fishing License and also a Trout Stamp</a> to target Steelhead on the North Shore of Lake Superior. Trout stamps typically run $10 for the year.

-   **Net**

    -   You don't need a fancy trout net, but you should have a net, and it should be big enough to fit the biggest fish that you expect to catch in it. If you hook into a 30" chrome steelhead you'd better hope your net it large enough to easily land it.
    -   If you don't already have a net, and you are looking to buy a net for steelheading I highly recommend getting a rubber net. They are easier on the fish, and they don't tangle with your hooks.

-   **Waders**

    -   Any old one-piece waders will do, but if you know you are going to fish for steelhead for more than one season look into a pair of stocking foot lightweight breathable nylon waders. You are fishing to have fun, and you'll have more fun if you aren't sweating and tired from hiking around in heavy waders with no ankle support.

-   **Sunglasses**

    -   They must be polarized. Not only will they allow you to see structure, they will sometimes let you see the steelhead. They are also a good piece of safety equipment protecting your eyes from split-shot and hooks, and they allow you to see the rocks you are walking on while traversing some fast and sometimes deep rivers.

-   **Nippers**
    -   Whatever kind you prefer. From $2 fingernail clippers to $100 cast aluminum Orvis nippers, as long as they cut through fishing line they'll work.
-   **Hemostats**
    -   I've recommended buying a pair of scissor mitten clamps in my <a href="/north-shore-steelhead-techniques">Fishing Lake Superior's North Shore Article</a>. You should buy one. They work great for almost any type of fishing, especially fly fishing.
-   **Scissors**
    -   Only if you fish yarn and use a snelled hook to hold the yarn instead of fishing pre-tied yarn flies.
-   **Hooks**
    -   If you fish yarn on snelled hooks, or fish with beads you'll need extra hooks. I've tried many different types of hook brands, in different sizes. I typically use smaller hooks than the average fisherman, ranging from size 8 all the way down to size 14.
-   **Pack/Vest**
    -
-   **Barrel Swivels**
    \*
-   **Strike Indicators**
    -   **Airfo Airlock Strike Indicators:** I use 3/4" and 1" Airlock indicators most of the time. They are durable, easy to see, easy to change depth, and easy to change between sizes and colors. The only cons are that they are relatively heavy making them harder to roll cast than other strike indicators, and there are better indicator options when using a vertical nymphing technique (described below).
    -   **Thill Bobbers:**
    -   **Foam Indicators:**
-   **Split Shot**
    -   You'll want an assortment of spit shot depending on the depth, and speed and the water as well as the technique you are using. I mostly use #B, #BB, #3/0, #7, and #5 Split Shot depending on depth and the type of presentation.
