I am very excited to see a Live Target Lure in this box. I have looked at them so many times and just couldn't bring myself to pay $16 for one lure. The colors of the soft plastics weren't what I would have picked out in a store, but seen like great for slightly dirtier waters.

## Threadfin Shad Baitball Squarebill

I am still undecided on whether these Livetarget baits are actually going to help catch fish, or are just built to catch fisherman. They are beautiful, extremely lifelike, and have a great action in the water, but for a lure that costs over $15 I am always more cautious about throwing it around waters that it could get snagged in.

## Swimming Craw

These are basically identical to the NetBait Paca Craw, which I have used in the past. They are hollow in the center and not as soft as other competing craws.

## Ring Worm 7"

I love fishing with ribbed soft plastics. One of my go to confidence baits are the <a href="http://www.lftlures.com/catalog/lft-ring-fry">Lake Fork Tackle Ring-Fry</a>. If I wasn't going to wacky rig a bait, it is nice to have a bait like the Ring Worm 7" to give a little extra flair with its ribbon tail.

## 8" Attacker Needle

I rigged this up on a shakey head, which may not have been the best application. They are not extremely buoyant and the length of them makes them not stand strait up. However they have just enough tail action that I was able to work this shakey head rigged worm as a texas rig. After my first short strike I reeled in fast to get the bait back out and got slammed on the retrieve.

## Swinging Rugby Jig 3/4 oz

Swinging jigs are the new fad, and these VMC's are well built. The extra hook shank length seems to help keep your bait off of the weight and allow for more movement. I personally like finesse style slow sinking baits, and 3/4 oz is a little heavy, especially where I was fishing that has rocks and boulders that will snag even the most snag proof baits.

## BaitMate Live Bass

Sample of Baitmate live bass. Wasn't as stinky as I thought it would be, but it definitely won't hurt to add it to your soft plastics.
