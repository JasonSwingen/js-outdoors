It is finally that time of year again. Well almost. Time to put on your broadheads, tune your arrows, and get out in the woods looking for a few prime locations.

This year I will be hunting in zone 16B.

## Scouting for the first time

I went out to get my bearings on where the hiking, snowmobile, and bike trails are as well as look for defined deer trails, and oaks. The main takeaway from this first scouting trip was that the storm from a few weeks ago was devastating to the entire area. There were trees down everywhere. Many trees that fell across the hiking and biking trails had been cut back, but it's going to be quite a bit harder to navigate through so many downed trees.
