It is finally that time of year again. Well almost. Time to put on your broadheads, tune your arrows, and get out in the woods looking for a few prime locations.

This year I will be hunting in zone 16B.

## Scouting for the first time
August 21st

I went out to get my bearings on where the hiking, snowmobile, and bike trails are as well as look for defined deer trails, and oaks. The main takeaway from this first scouting trip was that the storm from a few weeks ago was devastating to the entire area. There were trees down everywhere. Many trees that fell across the hiking and biking trails had been cut back, but it's going to be quite a bit harder to navigate through so many downed trees.

## Placing my trail camera
August 28th

I have walked through my zone a few times looking for somewhere to hang my tree stand. The first deer tracks I found was going to a stream that was under one of the only trees left standing in the area. There was not a good shooting lane as the underbrush was thick, but I placed my trail camera just to see if that was a frequently used area.

# Hanging my stand
September 6th

I went out again to look for an even better spot for my tree stand. A stream is not good enough to consistently pull in deer so I sent looking for a food source and bedding areas and I think I found the perfect spot. There are not many oak trees in my zone but I did find two fairly close together, and after a little more scouting I found a bedding area around 150 yards away.

September 17th

Bow Season just started today, and I'm glad it's finally here. I couldn't have waited much longer. I went out mid afternoon and had a good long sit. There wasn't much movement during the afternoon, but just after sunset a little fork-horn came right in and walked within 25 yards with two more deer following slightly further away. I grabbed my bow, but the sun had gone down and they were in some thicker cover. I drew my bow back, but I was unable to tell if the deer at 35 yards was a doe or another fork-horn, so I didn't let an arrow fly.

September 21st

I hit the woods again hoping to get a better look at those deer. At 5:30 p.m. I spotted a flash of brown and grabbed for my binoculars hoping not to see any antlers. Unfortunately, this was another yearling buck. He walked right at me and stopped within 15 yards of me, then circled around and stopped 20 yards on the my other side. He began acting as if something wasn't quite right and I figured he had caught my sent, until I heard some rustling from the brush. Another slightly bigger, yet still small yearling buck stepped out and stood 15 yards from me as well. As if they both new that I wasn't allowed to shoot. It was somewhat frustrating to have two deer so close that I wasn't able to shoot, but it also very cool watching them interact without knowing I was there.
