I assumed that waiting to hunt Montana in mid November would put me in primetime for some cold weather and rutting bucks. Well The bucks were definitely in the rut, but it was hotter than it was for early season bowhunting.

I set up at a range in North Dakota on my way to make sure I was sighted in. I bought a new type of bullet and was thinking about switching from my old trusty <a target="_blank" href="https://www.remington.com/ammunition/centerfire-rifle/core-lokt">Remington CoreLokt</a> 130gr bullets to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.winchester.com/Products/rifle-ammunition/Performance/Deer-Season-XP/Pages/default.aspx">Winchester Deer Season XP</a> also in 130gr. After putting a few of each downrange my CoreLokt's were hitting closer to center, but they were not grouping very well. My Deer Season XP's were hitting 5 inches high at 100 but with four shots in a group the size of a golf ball I decided to switch to Winchester this season.

I waited to leave for North Dakota so I would be able to drive through some of the country that I might be hunting, and possibly find some of the main areas the deer are moving through. It was just before sunset and I started seeing deer all over. Most of the deer I saw were in small groups of does and bucks. After a few more miles of seeing small groups of deer and small bucks I came across a group of deer right off the road with a really nice buck.

The first morning Mark, his brother Joel and I took off early for my first day of mule deer hunting for the year. We spent the first hour of the morning glassing of some coulees from the road. Then after not seeing many deer (at least nothing worth going after) we found a good looking coulee to walk down.
