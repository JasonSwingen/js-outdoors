I assumed that waiting to hunt Montana in mid November would put me in primetime for some cold weather and rutting bucks. Well The bucks were definitely in the rut, but it was hotter than it was for early season bowhunting.

I set up at a range in North Dakota on my way to make sure I was sighted in. I bought a new type of bullet and was thinking about switching from my old trusty Remington CoreLokt 130gr bullets to Winchester Deer Season XP also in 130gr. After putting a few of each downrange my CoreLokt's were hitting closer to center, but they were not grouping very well. My Deer Season XP's were hitting 5 inches high at 100 but with four shots in a group the size of a golf ball I decided to switch to Winchester this season.
