So you are thinking about getting into the world of *swinging for steelhead* and other anadromous fish. Well, there is a lot to cover, including gear, techniques, spey casts and more. But first, and most important you should decide if swinging is right for you.

Many of us started out fishing with a hook, link, and sinker. You stuck a worm or minnow on your hook, tied on a bobber and waited. Then eventually after a while we decided to try casting spoons and lures. It wasn't quite as easy or as simple as the old worm on a hook, but it was maybe a little bit more satisfying. Then finally, (hopefully) you picked up a fly rod and started fly fishing. Not because you can catch more fish on a fly rod than a spinning rod, but because it requires a higher level of skill that gives us more satisfaction when we catch fish using a new technique.

Swinging flies can be thought of as that next step in the progression of a fisherman. Learning a new technique, not because it is easier, but because increasing the difficulty increases your satisfaction. You might not be at the level in which making fishing more difficult is worth it and that's ok. So on one hand swinging flies may not be for you. But if you already have a fly rod, then learning how to spey cast will 100% make you a better fly fisherman.

> "The next step in the progression of the angler, is simply making fishing more difficult in order to increase your level of satisfaction."

So I'll cut to the chase. After swinging flies for a few years I have come to understand the basic pros and cons. If you are brand new to fly fishing and would need to buy all new gear, learn new casts, and only focus on catching fish on the swing probably isn't option (at least for now). Swinging is a gamble, you need to spend more time on the water and will most likely catch less fish. If you are just starting out fishing for steelhead, you should read my article on <a href="/fishing/steelhead-techniques/">fly fishing for steelhead</a> first.

### Pros
  - You get to feel the fish take your fly
  - You don't have to watch your indicator all day
  - You can fish the water that other anglers don't
  - You will get snagged less and loose less flies

### Cons
  - You will probably catch less fish
  - You need to buy more fishing gear (pro?)




If you have been fly fishing for a little while now and are just ready for a new challenge, you want to improve your fly fishing abilities, or you are looking for that next level of satisfaction then you should definitely learn to swing. Having a steelhead slam a swung fly is just about as satisfying as fishing can be, and can send you back into that *juvenile level of happiness*.

###  You Should Still Learn How To Spey Cast

So if you have decided that just aren't ready to spend the time, or don't want to spend the extra money on gear that it takes to swing flies for steelhead, or you simply content indicator fishing **you should still learn how to spey cast**. Having at the very least a basic understanding of spey casting will give you more tools at your disposal for all types of fly fishing. Spey casting (which is the type of two-handed fly cast used when swinging flies) by its basic definition is simply a water-loaded change of direction cast, unlike a roll cast that is a water loaded cast that must be performed in a perpendicular direction. Having the ability to move your fly line from down river to across or even up river without any room for a back-cast will allow you to reach water at further distances and in tighter spots. No matter if happen to be fishing a streamer, wet fly, nymph, or even a dry fly. <b>You don't need to have specific spey casting gear to learn how to spey cast</b>, (but it sure does help).

If you are ready to give it a try without breaking the bank, then the cheapest and easiest option is to just pick up a single handed skagit line for your single handed fly rod. You won't be able to cast as far as you would with a two-handed rod, but it is a great option for the occasional swinger. Just buy another spool and load it up with some running line, a skagit head, and a couple of sink tips and you can get into the swing game for less than $100.
