## The Fly Fishing Gear You Didn't Know You Needed

These products won't necessarily help you catch more or bigger fish, but they can make your time on the water more enjoyable. Below are a few of my favorite fishing and non-fishing products that help me (and can help you) be more efficient on the water.

{% for item in site.data.accessories %}

{% if item.Name %}
##### {{item.Name}}
{% endif %}

{% if item.Description %}
{{item.Description}}
{% endif %}

{% if item.Link %}
<span title="Buy {{item.Name}} on Amazon">{{item.Link}}</span>
{% endif %}

{% endfor%}

If you have an accessory that you can't live without on the water, please share it in the <a href="#comments">comments below</a>!
