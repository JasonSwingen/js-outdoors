I will be presenting on fly fishing techniques, gear, and knots used to catch Lake Superior Steelhead during the next <a href="http://arrowheadflyfishers.com/" target="_blank">Arrowhead Fly Fishers</a> meeting on Jan 15th, at 7 p.m. at Clyde Iron Works.

When I first started steelheading it was crazy to think that you could tie on a fly or colorful ball of yarn the size of your fingernail, toss it into a muddy fast moving river and somehow catch a steelhead. It took me an entire season struggling to get my first fish on the fly, and looking back at my flies and the technique I was using, it was no wonder I didn't catch any. Skip the learning curve and learn new techniques and rigging tips to help you catch steelhead on the fly!
