So you think you want to get into the world of swinging for steelhead. There is a lot to cover, and even more opinions on techniques and gear you should be using, but first you should decide if swinging is right for you. But even if you don't think swinging is right for you I truly believe learning how to spey cast will improve your fly fishing by allowing you to reach further distances in tighter spots with your standard streamer or nymphing rigs.

Fishing should never be something that you master or get comfortable with. And if you do get comfortable you should experiment and try learning something new. I've talked to fisherman that have been standing on the same rock, using the same rod/reel/line, with the same fly/egg/spawn-sack that they have used since before the internet was invented. If that is all you want to do then I'm not saying that you should stop, but I just want to let you know that there is a whole new level of experience when you try something new and more challenging. We all remember that first steelhead, or bass, or walleye that we caught and how exciting it was. Don't get me wrong, I will always get excited when I catch any fish (especially a steelhead), but catching one on the swing is your best option in getting that "first fish adrenaline rush".

Just like many other aspects in life the more energy and effort you put into something the more you get out.

Many of us starting out with a hook, link, and sinker. Place a worm or minnow on your hook, tie on a bobber and wait. Then eventually we moved onto casting lures. And finally, picked up a fly rod and dove into the world of fly fishing. I feel that swinging flies is simply the next step in the progression of the angler. Catching steelhead or any fish for that matter can easily be done with the simplest forms of fishing. You can catch a steelhead or nearly any fish with a worm and hook, but as fly-fisherman I believe we shouldn't just monotonously go through the motions, but challenge ourselves to try something different and more challenging. You will not catch as many fish as you would nymphing, but if all you cared about is catching the most amount of fish there are much easier ways that fly-fishing, and that is the reason why we do it. So to summarize - swinging flies isn't for everyone. It depends on what you care about more the destination or the trip. As well as your dedication, ability to put time in on the water, and willingness to catch less fish, but have each fish you do catch be that much more special.

Swinging flies can be extremely intimating. New rods, reels, lines, flies, techniques. Should you really go out and buy hundreds of dollars worth of gear just to catch steelhead in a less efficient way? It seems a little counter intuitive. Then once you have all that new gear are you going to actually use it, or will it end up like your old spinning rods stacked in the corner of your garage.

The good thing is that that you don't necessarily need to go out and buy a bunch of new gear to get started. The first fish I ever caught on the swing was using a 9' 5wt fly rod with floating line, a rod that you probably already have. I simply tied on a weighted streamer and extended my leader to 12'. A forceful roll cast clumsily got my fly to the other side of the main current towards the tailout of a large pool and a few seconds into the swing my rod was nearly pulled out of my hand. With the confidence that I could catch a steelhead on the swing allowed me to put more time in swinging and a few days later I hooked two more steelhead on the swing!

You don't *need* a dedicated rod/reel/line to swing, but it makes it easier (and more fun). Before you go out and spend a few hundred dollars on a new rod you should try single handed spey fishing. You can use your typical 9' 8wt or 7wt that you use for nymphing, buy another spool and load it up with some running line, a skagit head, and some sink tips and you can get into the swing game for less than $100.

If you don't want to mess around and are ready to dive in and get rigged up for swinging you'll need to get some new gear, so let's go over some of the options you have.

If you do a search for the perfect swinging rod you'll most likely find a bunch of information about fishing big west coast rivers, which a rod that works out there will work in the Great Lakes area, but it may not be the best solution. The rivers around here, like the Bois Brule and north shore rivers are not that big, and fish aren't nearly as big or have as high of flows as on the west coast so you can get away with shorter two-handed rods and lighter lines.

## Gear You Will Need to Swing

-   rod
-   reel
-   backing
-   running line
-   shooting head
-   sink tips
-   leader
-   flies

### Rod
Pretty simple, just get an 11' 7wt switch rod. Yes, you can get by with really anything from a single handed 9' 6wt up to a 13' 8wt sprey rod, but if you don't want to struggle casting or get hung up in the overhanging trees all day, just get what is proven to work in 95% of the Great Lakes tributaries, the 30-06 of switch rods, an 11' 7wt.

### Reel
The most important factors when picking out a reel weight, line capacity, and a fully enclosed spool.
You don't need to skimp on weight. Often a reel on the heavier side will balance out your 11' rod better than a lighter one. It can be tiring and out-right frustrating to work at holding the end of your rod tip up all day long.
Mid-arbor and small-arbor reels are a must a shooting head style line setup will take up more room on your reel than your standard fly fishing line setup You'll want to be able to add a decent amount of backing behing your running line, shooting head, sink tips, and leader.
Because running line is much smaller in diameter than your typical fly line, having an enclosed spool will keep it from passing in between your reel and spool, which can cause your running line to kink and weaken or even worse get stuck while you are fighting a fish. Spey reels are always built this way, but you can pick up a standard fly reel with an enclosed spool for often the same price if not slightly more.

### Backing
Your standard 20 or 30 lb backing will work just fine. Just make sure you use backing that is heavier than the heaviest leader you think you'll ever use. If you are going to fish for king salmon and may tie on a 20 lb leader you should have backing that is at least 20 lbs. Fill your reel up with at least 100 yds of backing, but add more to make sure your spool is full when the rest of your shooting head system is tied on.

### Running Line
Instead of a weight forward fly line that has a skinnier back end to allow the line to shoot out of your rod a shooting head system is broken into separate parts, the shooting head is the weight forward part of your line and the running line lets the head shoot. There is some give and take when it comes to running line. The skinnier the line the further you can cast, but it also makes it difficult to hold onto in the cold months when you will be using it. Vice-versa a thicker line ease easier to handle, but will not allow for cast quite as far. You don't want to go too light however because having thicker line causes drag on your guides as you cast and will help to straighten our your shooting head. Having too light of running line will could cause you to cast further, but will cause your line to fall in a clump. Generally 30-50 lb running line is used for the majority of setups in the great lakes.

### Shooting Head
There are two general categories of shooting heads, scandi and skagit. As great lakes steelheaders we are more interested in the later. Although somewhat similar in idea, scandi and skagit greatly in use, techniques, and gear needed. Scandi heads are meant more for the tributaries in scandinavia where there are fewer trees, the water is much wider, but comparitivly shallower. Scandi heads are much longer and typically used with long 13 to 15 ft (or longer) spey rods. A cast known as a "touch and go" cast allows for extream distances, but the long skinnier head doesn't allow for sink tips, or large flies.
Skagit heads, which are what you'll want are much more compact and will allow you to throw heavy sink tips and big flies. There are many different brands of skagit heads these days, each with their own pros and cons. One of the most popular brands is the OPST Commando head.

### Swinging Streamers

The basics of swinging streamers include casting a fly at roughly a 45-degree downstream angle and letting your streamer "swing" across the river. This is a great technique to cover lots of water as well as catch aggressive steelhead.

Streamers are often swung with the use of a specific type of two-handed (switch or spey) rod and a (shooting head) fly line that allows you to cast weighted flies across larger rivers

**You can easily switch to this technique from a running line nymphing setup**. Just remove your leader and add a shooting head, sink tip and tippet.

-   **Rigging:** There are endless options for fly lines to use when swinging streamers. The most common setup is backing, shooting line (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ulomKg">30-40lb Lazer Line</a>), a shooting head (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2U5lcZq">OPST Commando Head</a>), a sink tip (<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ycqq4V">RIO Mow tips</a>), and a level tippet (usually fluorocarbon) in 10-15 lbs and roughly 4ft long. You'll want a heavier tippet since fish will often strike a streamer extremely aggressively.

### Stripping Streamers

This type of streamer fishing could almost be combined with swinging streamers. At the end of your swing, you should always strip your fly back to you since a fish may have seen your fly and is waiting to strike. However, you can also strip streamers without swinging them first. Especially in slack water and deep pools.

You can use a two hand (switch rod) for this, but your standard 7-8wt 9-10ft fly rod is ideal. The smaller tributaries found on the north shore will allow you to use a standard weight forward line or a sink tip line. If you only have a floating line and want to fish deeper sections or pools I would highly recommend buying a few assorted <a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TpTvpY">PolyLeaders</a>. These replace your nylon leader with one that essentially turns your floating line into a sink tip. You can easily switch to this technique from a (fly line) nymphing setup.

-   **Rigging:** Any weight forward fly line will work, although I prefer floating lines since you can always use heavier flies or add on a PolyLeader to get deeper, it is not as easy to fish full sinking and sink tip lines in shallow riffles and runs. Just like swinging streamers, you will want to use 3-4ft of a heavier tippet (10-15lb) since fish will often strike a streamer extremely aggressively!
