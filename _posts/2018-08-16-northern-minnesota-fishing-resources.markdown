After moving to Duluth in early 2014 I searched all over for new fishing locations and information to help get an idea of the fishing opportunities in the area. Starting out, the only fishing I could find was  off bridges of nearby lakes and rivers for bass, walleye, and pike.

It took me quite a while to get an understanding of all of the possibilities in the area. I didn't even know there were steelhead in Lake Superior, or even what a steelhead was for that matter. I had only heard of lake trout being caught from charters, and that booking a trip from hundreds of dollars was my only way to get a chance at catching them.

One day my friend Ben texted me saying he would like to try fishing from shore of Lake Superior. I wasn't too convinced we would have a change. With all that water out there how were we supposed to catch these trout and salmon from shore? Well, we grabbed a bunch of spoons and our longest rods and hit the shore well before sunrise. It didn't take long before Ben had hooked a rainbow trout and not long after I hooked a steelhead that peeled line like no fish I had ever caught and jumped out of the water multiple times. You can read more about that trip from my <a href="/fishing/rainbow-trout-fishing-on-lake-superior/">Rainbow Trout Fishing on Lake Superior</a> article.

I was so happy that I found a new opportunity and a new species to target, but felt that I had been missing out by not taking advantage of a fishery that I didn't even know existed. From then on I decided to talk to more local fisherman, explore new shops and join local fishing organizations so I wasn't missing out on any more fantastic fishing. I later went to a spey casting clinic put on by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.greatlakesflyfish.com/">Great Lakes Fly Shop</a>, where I learned you can catch steelhead in the rivers during the spring. I also joined the local <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GitcheGumeeTU/">Gitche Gumee chapter of Trout Unlimited</a> and found out that there were large schools of <a href="/fishing/north-shore-pink-salmon/">pink salmon</a> that swim up the rivers on the north shore in the fall.

That is why I decided to write this article. I hope you are able to join a new organization, stop in one of the local fly shops, or even hire a guide. I was once intimidated by new waters, and new species, but there are many great people and resources that will help you get into fly fishing, or shore fishing for the first time. Many of you may have probably grown up fishing, but need some help getting back into it. You may be from Southern Minnesota and want to take a trip up to the north shore and want to know where to start. You may even be a bass or walleye fisherman that thinks its just to difficult to get into fly-fishing or shore fishing for trout and salmon. I encourage you to try something different and see if you too have been missing out on something you really enjoy.
