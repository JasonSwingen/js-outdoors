I'm not going to lie. This bowhunting season started off to a rough start, and got worse.

I was extremely excited for this year's bow season. I had just gotten my first buck with a bow the previus year and had a higher level of confidence. I had also upgraded some of my equipment and been shooting more this year than ever before. I felt confident and been seeing deer on my trail camera.

That excitement soon subsided after my first two morning sits resulting in walking into the woods only to spook deer that had been standing directly under my stand, then my next handful of hunts not seeing a single deer. I had to convince myself that I hadn't scared all the deer out of the woods and ruined my locations I kept hunting. All I wanted was to see a deer, to give myself some confidence that I was setup in the right areas.

After seven sits of bumping a few deer or simply not seeing any I finally saw my first ungulate of the year. Naturally, because the city hunt requires that I shoot an antlerless deer before a buck, the first deer I saw was a buck. It was just a fork-horn, but he was still a welcome sight in the quiet woods. Soon after watching the buck walk back behind my stand I turned around to see a big black blob through the woods about 40 yards in front of me. It took a few seconds of intense blinking to realize it was a black bear. I watched as it stood up and scratched it's back on a tree, then got back on all fours and slowly walked right toward my tree. It walked within 10 feet of my tree and just kept on walking.

## The Lows of Bowhunting

After only seeing that one small buck and watching two deer run by just before last light I decided to more locations. So I setup my climber in a tree in the middle of some oak trees and waited for a good wind to come back for a hunt.

I went back in to hunt a few days later. It was the first morning that temperature had dipped below freezing and I was expecting to see some movement. It had just settled down in my stand and looked off over my left shoulder and saw a deer standing within 20 yards of my stand. It was still pretty dark out, but I could tell it was a fawn. I grabbed for my bow and waited for more light.

After 10 minutes it was just starting to get light out. Just before shooting light as I was watching the fawn I heard leaves crunching behind me. I slowly turned and watched a nice 8-point buck walk up over a hill and walk directly towards the fawn. He stopped to freshen up a scrape, then continued on walking within 15 yards of my stand. I still needed an antlerless deer before I could shoot the buck. So I watched the buck walked right past me and up to the fawn on the other side of my stand. The fawn jumped and I thought the buck was going to chase it off, but it looped around and started walking down a path 25 yards from me. I drew back my bow and grunted to stop the deer. It stopped with a sapling directly in front of it's vitals. I leaned off to the right to get a little better angle and shot.

Whack! I watched as the arrow hit the deer. It looked like a great shot, but I had held too close to its front shoulder because the tree was in my way and I hit it right in the shoulder. I watched the deer run off with my arrow mostly sticking out of it's side. I didn't know what to think. It seemed like a good shot, but it didn't look like I had very good penetration. Because I was using a lighted nock I could see that my arrow had fallen out a maybe 20-30 yards away.

I sat up in my stand for 15 minutes trying to convince myself it was a good shot, then thinking my arrow just bounced off it's shoulder somehow. If I could just look at my arrow I would know. So I climbed out of my stand to grab my arrow, but just as I got to my arrow I heard a deer run off in the woods...

I texted my wife to come help track the deer, becoming more and more worried that that deer I had heard was the one that I had shot, and because of my lack of patience I had bumped it. We spend the rest of the day tracking that deer only finding small drops of blood for over 200 yards. Then eventually we lost blood. I called a few friends to help me track it in the afternoon, but we still weren't able to find the deer or any more blood. I went back in the next morning as well and walking circles around the last drop of blood, until I was physically and mentally exhausted but I never recovered the deer.

I was so anxious to finally get a deer that I ended up not recovering it at all. This was the first deer I have ever shot (gun or bow) and not recovered. It's a sickening feeling that I never want to happen again. I kept running the scenario through my head again and again. If only I had waited for more light. If only I didn't stop the deer and let it stop on its own. It only I didn't get out of my stand so soon.

I didn't think I could deal with injuring another deer and was thinking about packing up the bow for at least the season if not good.



I was so anxious to have finally got a deer that I forgot to be patient and give it time. I am sure I would have recovered the deer if I just would have waited another hour. It's not easy for me to write about my mistakes, but I'm not going to pretend that this was just an accident and there was nothing I could have done. In hindsight there are many things I would have done different, but that is part of hunting and part of life. Learn from your mistakes and don't make them again.

It takes less time to wait after your shot that it does to rush in and jump your deer.

This was the worst I've felt as a bowhunter. I spent the next week deciding if I should even keep bowhunting or just at least the rest of the season off.

I decided that the built up pressure of knowing I hadn't recovered the last deer I shot would weight on me too much throughout the year, so I decided to get back in the stand.

## Getting Back in the Stand

A week later I decided to get back in the woods. I didn't think I would be able to mentally handle losing another deer so I was only going to shoot if I had a deer standing broadside, within 20 yards, during the day, that didn't know I was there. After my slow start to the season I wasn't very optomistic, but the rut was just starting to pick up and I was starting to see a few more deer on my trail camera during the day.

Since the Duluth City Bowhunt requires that you shoot an antlerless deer before you shoot a buck I was still in search of an antlerless deer before I could start chasing some bucks that I had recently seen on my trailcamera.

My first morning hunt started off like any hunt this year, with a deer running off in the darkness as I made my way to my stand. After seeing a few small bucks chasing does around a few days before I decided to just stick it out since it was a cold morning and the deer would likely be on the move. Mid-morning I saw two deer running below a hill and not long after I looked over to see a wolf walking down a path about 60 yards from me. Then a few hours later another wolf came walking up over the hill in front of me.

Seeing wolves while deer hunting may irritate some hunters, but If it weren't for deer hunting I wouldn't spend even close to the amount of time in the woods watching birds, bears, coyotes, and wolves. It's a great excuse to spend time in the outdoors and see some very cool sights.

After I watched those two wolves and a few deer running from a the other side of a hill I decided to move locations. I quietly snuck down out of my climber and moved down the hill to where I seen a few deer running by earlier in the morning.

After I got settled into the new spot I looked down and saw some movement through the trees. It was just a button buck moving slowly through the trees. I watched him slowly move for 15-20 minutes, then all of a sudden he looked up and perked his ears up. About the same time I heard some rustling in the leaves in front of me. I looked up and saw 3 deer doming right towards me. The little buck starting running after them.

As soon as he got up to them they took off. One of the fawns ran around a small frozen marsh and stopped quartering away a few feet in front of a down tree I had just ranged earlier at 20 yards. I drew back my bow and settled my pin directly behind it's shoulder and let an arrow fly. It was a perfect shot. I watched as the lighted nock flew perfectly through where I was aiming. The deer jumped then took a few steps and fell over within 8 yards.

<!-- I was so happy to get a great shot on a deer, and honestly I wouldn't have taken a shot unless it was an a daylight shot at a antlerless deer that was standing still, broadside or quarting away, within 20 yards, and that didn't know I was there. And that's just what happened. because I there is more to my hunting story that I had left out and have a hard time talking about. and  I was cutting it close with my Montana hunting trip coming up in a few days, but I was happy to get some meat in the freezer and to finally start hunting bucks! -->

I was finally able to start hunting bucks, and more importantly I had comfindence in myself again, but I also knew I didn't have a lot of time left. Thanksgiving was coming up and winter storm was coming with it. I had two days to hunt before a winter storm predicting to bring nearly two feet of snow.
