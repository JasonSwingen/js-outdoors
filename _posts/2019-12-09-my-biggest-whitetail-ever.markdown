I'm not going to lie. This season started off to a rough start. It started off slow, not seeing any deer, then I started getting into deer, but unfortunately it was while I was walking in to my stand 2 mornings in a row in different stand locations. The first deer was standing a few feet from my stand as I was walking in, and ran off stomping and blowing for 20-30 minutes trying to figure out what I was. After hunting the rest of the morning and not seeing anything I decided to sit in my other stand the next morning. Just like my sit before I was heading into my stand in the dark and just before I got to my stand I walked right through the woods into another deer.

Then my next handful of sits not seeing any deer had me telling my self that I must have scared all of the deer out of the woods.

I just wanted to see a deer. After only hearing deer running away in the darkness I was ready to at least see one. Eventually I did, although it was just a fork-horn.

Right after I watched the fork-horn walked by my stand I turned back and saw a large black blob 40 yards in front of me. A black bear had wandered through the woods and stopped right in front of my stand. It stood up and scratched it's back on a tree, then within 5 yards of the tree I was in.

## The Lows of Bowhunting

After not seeing much for deer my previous handful of hunts I decided to move locations. I setup my climber in a tree in the middle of some oak trees and waited for a good wind to come back for a hunt.

I went back in to hunt a few days later. It was the first morning that temperature had dipped below freezing and I was expecting to see some movement. It had just settled down in my stand and looked off over my left shoulder and saw a deer standing within 20 yards of my stand. It was still pretty dark out, but I could tell it was a fawn.

After 10 minutes it was just starting to get light out, and just before shooting light as I was watching the fawn I heard leaves crunching behind me. I slowly turned and watched a decent 8-point buck walk up over a hill and walk directly towards the fawn. He stopped to freshen up a scrape, then continued on walking within 15 yards of my stand. I still needed an antlerless deer before I could shoot the buck. So I watched the buck walked right past me and up to the fawn on the other side of my stand. The fawn jump and I thought the buck was going to chase it off, but it looped around and started walking down a path 25 yards from me. I drew back my bow and grunted to stop the deer. It stopped with a sapling directly in front of it's vitals. I leaned off to the right to get a little better angle and shot.

Whack! I hit the deer perfectly up and down, but I had held too close to its front shoulder because the tree was in my way and I hit it right in the shoulder. I watched the deer run off with my arrow mostly sticking out of it's side. I didn't know what to think. It seemed like a good shot, but I didn't know how much penetration I had. Because I was using a lighted nock I could see that my arrow had fallen out a maybe 20-30 yards away.

I sat up in my stand for 15 minutes trying to convince myself it was a good shot, then thinking my arrow just bounced off it's shoulder somehow. If I could just look at my arrow I would know. So I climbed out of my stand to grab my arrow, but just as I got to my arrow I heard a deer run off in the woods.

I texted my wife to come help track the deer, becoming more and more worried that that deer I had heard was the one that I had shot, and because of my lack of patience I had bumped it. We spend the rest of the day tracking that deer only finding small drops of blood for over 200 yards. I went back in the next morning as well and walking circles around the last drop of blood, but I never recovered the deer.

I was so anxious to finally recover my deer I forgot to be patient and give it time. It's hard for me to write about this, but I'm not going to pretend I'm some great hunter that never makes mistakes, and if you read this and take a few more seconds on your next hunt to stop, breathe, be patient.

## Getting Back in the Stand

After a week of second guessing whether I should keep bowhunting or not I decided to get back in the stand. I wasn't going to use my previous mistakes as a lesson and become a better hunter because of it.

    <figcaption>Since the Duluth City Bowhunt requires that you shoot an antlerless deer before you shoot a buck I was still in search of an antlerless deer before I could start chasing some bucks that I had seen on my trailcamera.</figcaption>

The morning hunt started off like any hunt this year, with a deer running off in the darkness as I made my way to my stand. After seeing a few small bucks chasing does around a few days before I decided to just stick it out since it was a cold morning and the deer would likely be on the move. Mid-morning I saw two deer running below a hill and not long after I looked over to see a wolf walking down a path about 60 yards from me. Then a few hours later another wolf came walking up right towards me.

If it weren't for deer hunting I wouldn't spend even close to the amount of time in the woods watching birds, bears, coyotes, and wolves. It's a great excuse to spend time in the outdoors and see some very cool sights.

After I watched those two wolves and a few deer running from a the other side of a hill I decided to move locations. I quietly snuck down out of my climber and moved down the hill to where I seen a few deer moving.

After I got settled into the new spot I looked down and saw some movement through the trees. It was just a button buck moving slowly through the trees. I watched him slowly move for 15-20 minutes, then all of a sudden he looked up and perked his ears up. About the same time I heard some rustling in the leaves in front of me. I looked up and saw 3 deer doming right towards me. The button buck starting running after them. As soon as he got up to them they took off. One of the fawns ran around a small frozen marsh and stopped quartering away a few feet in front of a down tree I had just ranged earlier at 20 yards. I drew back my bow and let an arrow fly. It was a perfect shot and the deer fell within 8 yards of my arrow.

<!-- I was so happy to get a great shot on a deer, and honestly I wouldn't have taken a shot unless it was an a daylight shot at a antlerless deer that was standing still, broadside or quarting away, within 20 yards, and that didn't know I was there. And that's just what happened. because I there is more to my hunting story that I had left out and have a hard time talking about. and  I was cutting it close with my Montana hunting trip coming up in a few days, but I was happy to get some meat in the freezer and to finally start hunting bucks! -->

I was finally able to start hunting bucks, but I knew I didn't have a lot of time left. Thanksgiving was coming up and winter storm was coming with it. I had two days to hunt before a winter storm predicting to bring over two feet of snow was going to hit over the Thanksgiving weekend.
