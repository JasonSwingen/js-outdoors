Fish Camp at the <a target="_blank" href="http://ladyslipperlodge.blogspot.com/">Lady Slipper Lodge</a> north of Remer MN. We spent the weekend ice-fishing for crappies and tip-up fishing for pike.

We had a few very successful days, catching a good meal for the four of us, plus a bonus pike on the tip-up.
