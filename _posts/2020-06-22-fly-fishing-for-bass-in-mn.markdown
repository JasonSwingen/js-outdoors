When I first started bass fishing I was not interested in the slightest in fly fishing. It was a foreign concept. I thought you could only fish for trout and you had to you tiny flies that where nearly impossible to tie onto your line. Then, one day I learned about streamers. That was the first spark that has eventually lead to a full blown inferno of immersion into fly fishing for bass, and eventually nearly every species that I had previously only spin-fished for. Yes, you can fly fish for nearly every type of fish you can spin fish for. Bass, pike, panfish, carp, catfish, muskies, walleye, trout, salmon... you get the point.

You will probably need different gear, different techniques, fish different locations, and use different flies for each of them. I'll get to them all eventually, but first let's cover the basics of what you will need to catch bass. I'll mainly cover smallmouth fishing, but touch on largemouth as well.

<h2 class="center"><u>The Gear</u></h2>


### Fly Rod
You can catch bass on nearly any sized fly rod, from a 7' 3wt fiberglass to a 9' 10' broomstick. Unlike species like steelhead that you are choosing a rod based on the size of fish you are catching, when it comes to bass fishing you will need to use a rod that is capable to throwing the flies you intend to use. If you are going to buy a dedicated fly rod for bass fishing, it is hard to beat a 9' 8wt. If you want to give up the ability to throw large flies all day, a 5, 6, or 7 weight will give you a better fight once you are hooked up. I prefer having a fast action rod that will allow you to make tight and efficient loops that will help you place your fly accurately and under over hanging branches.

Don't break the bank, but investing in a good stick will make fishing much more enjoyable. Most rods in the $200 to $500 range will be great options for bass fishing. Beyond $500 and you are paying more for the components and the name printed on the blank.

### Fly Reel
If you are only going to use this rod for bass fishing in freshwater, you **do not** need an expensive reel. The larger the arbor the better. Your backing will only be used to fill out the remaining portion of your reel, but you don't need to worry about getting into your backing with fighting smallmouth. Yes, bass can pull some drag, but think of it as a learning opportunity to learn how to palm you reel if it comes to it. Any 6-8 weight large arbor reel ranging from $50 to $100 should work. If you can, find a reel that either comes with or has fairly cheep spools. I'll cover why when we go over fly lines next.

### Fly Line
Use the money you saved on your fly reel to buy really good fly line. It is worth it, trust me. I started out fly fishing using $15 fly line. It. Was. Terrible. It is pretty incredible how much further and more accurate you can cast with good fly line. Fore most situations, a weight forward fly line will be your best option. Depending on your fly, you can fish on the surface or weighted flies down to around 10 feet deep.

Instead of buying a sink-tip line, adding a sink-tip to your floating line will be much more cost effective and let you cover even deeper water down to 15 or even 20 feet. It is also a great option for fishing un-weighted flies quickly as the sink tip will help break the surface tension and let you start fishing your fly as soon as it hits the water.

Additionally, you may want to look into a full sinking line. Later in the season, bass will move deeper and having the ability to get down to their level will make your fall fishing trips almost as good as the spring.

### Leader

Bass are not line shy like trout and salmon. You can, and should use heavier line when bass fishing. The main reason being, where there are bass, there are usually pike. It doesn't matter if you bought, or tied a fly. When you are fly fishing for bass and a have a pike swim up and bite your fly off, you'll wish you had heavier line.

The other reason why heavier tippet is beneficial, is to help turn your fly over. If you use a 9ft 5x leader and tie on a bulky bass fly, your are not going keep the energy traveling through your fly line to transfer into your leader and it will crumple into a pile at the end of your cast. Which will be frustrating, but not as frustrating as when you strip your line back in and realize how many knots you'll have to untangle.

You should never have to go below 10lb test. Anything between 10-20lb works great. My preferred tipped size is 15lb fluorocarbon when fishing streamers, or 12lb mono when fishing poppers.
