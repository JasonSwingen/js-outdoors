I have had many people ask me about how to fish for steelhead on the north shore. So I'm going to tell you everything you need to know to get started as well as give a few different techniques used to cover water the most effectively. This is not a complete summary of everything that you can use to catch a steelhead. You can also catch steelhead on streamers, dry flies, rapalas, spinners, and all sorts of different baits and using different techniques. I'm going go to over some of the most commonly used methods as well as teach you a few tips on adapting to conditions to cover water the most effectively.

I commonly hear anglers say that they would like to catch steelhead, but they don't have a fly rod, they don't know where to start. Only a few years ago I was in the same boat (figuratively though, since we are talking about steelheading), I spent a few seasons just going and watching other people fish, talking to some locals. The biggest help so far in learning how to catch steelhead was attending the local <a target="_blank" href="www.facebook.com/GitcheGumeeTU/">Gitche Gumme Trout Unlimited</a>'s monthly meetings.

## Equipment
* **Rod**
    * Most anglers user a fly rod to catch steelhead, but you can also use a spinning rod, or a baitcaster rod
    * The best rods are for the majority of north shore rivers are between 8 to 10ft long and are a medium to medium heavy action. If you have a fly rod or are going to buy one for steelhead a 9-10ft 8wt is an ideal setup. However, you can get by with a 6wt to a 9wt. Most north shore tributaries are small and have overhanging trees or rock walls that prohibit using rods longer that 9ft, but other rivers can more efficiently be covered with longer rods up to 11ft.
* **Reel**
    * Paired up to your rod. (7/8 wt fly reel, low profile baitcaster reel, medium sized spinning reel)
    * Make sure it has a good drag system. Steelhead will rip line from your reel and can sometime get caught in the current and you'll have no choice but to chase them down.
* **Line**
    * You can use fly line or mono with a fly rod, or mono with a spinning or baitcast rod.
    * Fly line: Weight forward floating line. Paired up to or slightly over-lined to your rod. (I like to use 9 or 10wt fly line on my 8wt fly rod to turn over heavy indicator setups)
    * Mono line: 6-10lb monofilament. (Higher abrasion resistance and visibility lines are best)
    * Leader: 6-8lb fluorocarbon. (recommended, but not a necessity)
* **Split Shot**
  * You'll want an assortment of spit shot depending on the depth, and speed and the water as well as the technique you are using. (I mostly use #B, #BB, #3/0, #7, and #5 Round Water Gremlin Split Shot)
* **Flies**
  * You can only use one fly on the North Shore of Lake Superior
  * Egg Patterns
    * Yarn flies are cheap, easy to tie, and a proven steelhead catcher.
    * Beads are growing in popularity and can be use
  * Classic Flies
    * Nymphs
    * Stoneflies
* **Fishing License / Trout Stamp**
  * You'll need a regular <a target="_blank" href="http://licenses.dnr.state.mn.us/">MN Fishing License and also a Trout Stamp</a> to target Steelhead on the North Shore of Lake Superior. Trout stamps are usually around $10 for the year.
* **Net**
  * You don't need a fancy trout net, but you will need a net, and it should be big enough to fit the biggest fish that you expect to catch in it. If you hook into a 30" chrome steelhead you'd better hope your net it large enough to easily land it.
  * If you don't already have a net, I highly recommend getting a rubber net. They are easier on the fish, and they don't tangle with your hooks.
* **Waders**
  * Any old waders will do, but if you know you are going to fish for steelhead for more than one season look into a pair of stocking foot lightweight breathable nylon waders.
* **Sunglasses**
  * They must be polarized. Not only will they allow you to see structure, they will sometimes let you see the steelhead. They are also a good piece of safety equipment protecting your eyes from split-shot and hooks, and they allow you to see the rocks you are walking on while traversing some fast and sometimes deep rivers.

## Techniques

There are many ways to catch steelhead, but to catch north shore steelhead the most common method is nymphing.

* Nymphing
    * Chuck-n-Duck - The most common way to fish for steelhead.
        * Slinky Rig
        * In-line Split Shot
        * Drop Shot
    * Euro Nymphing
      *
    * Indicator
        * Horizontal
          * 
        * Vertical
          *
          * *I learned this technique from Brent Notbohm who used it mostly on the Bois Brule river in Wisconsin, but works well in most larger rivers.*
