With surface temperatures reaching into the 70s the warm water of Lake Superior can be bad for trolling, but when the cold water pushes its way towards shore those looking to nab a few lake trout from shore get their chance.

A recent hike out to the north shore looking for lakers paid off and is hopefully a sign that the bite is about to start picking up.
