## BDOW 1/2 Spinnerbait
![BDOW 1/2 Spinnerbait](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/a/castaic_bdow_spinnerbait_web.jpg)

Quality spinnerbait with nice blades and a solid sharp hook. This is once of the most detailed spinnerbaits I have owned. The only thing I would have preferred is to have a larger hook, but since I use a trailer hook on most spinner and buzz baits anyway, this is not a big problem.

## Ikari Shad

I have only fished shallow rocky waters and only threw this bait a few times fearful of loosing it. The weight lets you cast it a mile and the build quality seems pretty good. Nice rattles with a medium slow wobble on the fall. The back treble hook on mine looked like the third tine soldered on was not aligned properly, so I had to replace it.

## Super Jerky J

These look like they will give a ton of action in the water. However, they really don't swim at all unless they are moving extremely fast.

## Pop Shadz

This was by far my favorite bait it the box. I caught 16 smallmouth the day after I received the August MTB and 6 of them were on the Z-man Pop Shadz. Those 6 fish were also the biggest smallies of the day. The lip is cupped enough to give the perfect amount of water dispersion, while still being able to easily walk-the-dog. If you pop it hard enough it will go sub-surface and entice those pickier fish to bite. I threw multiple top water baits that day and the Pop Shadz was the top performer. Will be buying more.

## 6" Lizard

I have not been a big creature bait user, but I was able to catch a smallie on one.

## D39z Fatgap Worm/Tube Hook 5/0

It's a wide gap hook. It's sharp, has a wide gap, and has a large fully-closed eye. You can't go wrong.
