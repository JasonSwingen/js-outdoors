## V & M Baits Heavy Hitter Football Jig
<!-- ![V & M Baits Heavy Hitter Football Jig](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/h/e/heavyhitterfootballjig_li-tequila_web.jpg) -->

Nice quality jig. It has a nice trailer, sharp hook, and the paint at least in the little I've used it seems like it will hold up to even the roughest rock piles.

## BioSpawn PlasmaTail 6.5"
<!-- ![BioSpawn PlasmaTail 6.5"](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/l/plasmatail_3.jpg) -->

These 6.5 inch BioSpawn PlasmaTails are fantastic. They have a great action because the they are tapered down just before the tail. This allows the the tip of the tail to move around with quite a bit of incising action.

## Biovex USA AMP Wake

Every time I have tried to use this bait it has either been too windy or I've been fishing in too deep of water. It has a great swimming action and the extra flashabou on the tail treble really helps this bait.

## 6th Sense Lures Snatch 70S
<!-- ![6th Sense Lures Snatch 70S](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/n/snatch70s.jpg) -->

A fantastic lipless crankbait. It is a great finesse bait that may not have the rattles to call fish from a long distance, but it also won't scare fish off when you rip it by them. What it lacks in rattles it gains in vibration. It is designed to flutter extremely easy from the raise and letting it fall.

## Yo-Zuri 3DB Square-Lip
<!-- ![Yo-Zuri 3DB Square-Lip](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/3/d/3dbsquare-lip.jpg) -->

The Yo-Zuri is a great bait to slow roll over weeds or to give it a steady retrieve and pop it against rocks. It is a fairly buoyant square bill and will allow you to quickly and easily get out of snags.

## V & M Baits Cliff's Wild Craw
<!-- ![V & M Baits Cliff's Wild Craw](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/c/l/cliffswildcraw_tw.jpg) -->

Good, but not as much action as I would have expected. My favorite craws are Rage Craws because you barely have to move them and the pinchers move like crazy. The long thin arms connected to big round pinchers on the Wild Craw will only move if on a heavy jig in free-fall or by burning them across the top of weeds.
The best way I found to rig these craws was to use a weighted EWG hook.

## Eagle Claw TroKar TK100 EWG Work Hook
<!-- ![Eagle Claw TroKar TK100 EWG Work Hook](http://mysterytacklebox.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/175x141/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/e/a/eagleclawtk110.jpg) -->

The best EWG hook I've used to date. They are sticky sharp, have a solid closed eyelet and have a good bend on them. 4/0 is a great size for the 6.5 inch BioSpawn PlasmaTails.
