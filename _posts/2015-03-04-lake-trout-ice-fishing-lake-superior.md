Last year Duluth had an intensely cold winter which froze nearly all of Lake Superior allowing anglers the opportunity to travel miles onto the lake in search of monster lakers. This year was not nearly as cold but there was still enough of the lake that froze over to allow many fisherman get onto the ice.

I had never been trout fishing before other than catching a few small rainbow trout as a kid. After talking to a few guys getting off the lake and talking to the bait shop employees I bought a few more pieces of equipment and was ready to give it a shot.

## What Equipment You Will Need

If you are already ice fish and want to get into lake trout fishing there are only a few more things you will need. If you are fishing on the Minnesota side of Lake Superior you will need a trout stamp as well as your fishing license. Currently they are only $10. You will also need a heavy rod. These rods can be picked up for a very reasonable price at many different sporting good stores. I ended up buying an [HT Laker Pro XL](http://www.amazon.com/HT-LKP-32MH-32-Inch-Heavy-Laker/dp/B00AU5SJAS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425519560&sr=8-1&keywords=ht+laker+pro) heavy rod in 44" for only $25. When fishing in a smaller shelter the 44" can seem a little large, but when you get a lake trout on the the other end you will be happy you have a little extra cushion for their long, powerful runs. You shouldn't need to buy a reel and can simply remove one of your summer reels off of its rod. I am using a [Diawa Exceler 2500](http://www.amazon.com/Daiwa-Exceler-2500-Spinning-Black/dp/B00LDYJLES/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425519641&sr=8-1&keywords=daiwa+exceler) and have been very impressed with it. Just make sure that it can hold plenty of line and has a good drag. When it comes to line I used 20 pound braid with a few feet of 20 pound fluorocarbon leader. I would recommend using a strong swivel to attach your main line to leader as many trout baits tend to spin. Speaking of baits there are a few different ways to catch these fish. Leave your finesse at home, because when it comes to lake trout they can be extremely aggressive and will swim the entire depth of water your are fishing to attach your bait. The basics include loud, smelly, and white. You can get bites off of jigging raps, rattling traps, spoons, tube jigs, swim baits, bucktails, and other similar jigs.

## What Depth You Should Fish In

The short answer is 60 to 120 feet. You can catch them in shallower and deeper what, but that is where they seem the majority of their time. At least in Lake Superior during the winter. I've done most of my fishing in 70 to 80 feet. A flasher is an extremely helpful tool. Not just to check your depth, but to find these fish wherever they are in the water column. I recently purchased a [Marcum LX-3tc](http://www.amazon.com/Marcum-LX-3tc-Color-Fishfinder-System/dp/B0041IVNRG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425519532&sr=8-1&keywords=marcum+lx3) and have been very happy with it. Most often you will see walleye on the bottom, and crappies suspended in deeper water, but lake trout can be anywhere from just below the ice to popping off the bottom.

Lake trout fishing has been the most exiting ice fishing I have have ever done. It is extremely fun fighting these large aggressive fish. If you are close to Lake Superior or any other lake with lake trout I would highly recommend giving it a try.

I caught this fish off of a 3.5 inch white tube jig in 75 feet of water. I let the jig free fall until it hit bottom then bounce it against the ground a few times and then would lift it a few feet off the bottom. After a few repetitions a huge mark showed up on my Marcum and caught my jig right at its peak a few feet off the bottom. I didn't even have time to set the hook. My rod was bend all the was over and my reel was screaming. It took five minutes until I finally saw him. It is amazing seeing these fish fight through such clear ice and water. You can see 30 feet down and the ice is often like glass. They will flex and roll and just when they get to the hole and you think you are done they will take off clear to the bottom of the lake again. The entire fight too over 10 minutes and I ended up soaking both arms up to my elbows trying to get him onto the ice. He ended up weighing over 15 pounds and was nearly 35 inches in length.
