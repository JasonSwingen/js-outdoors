My First [Mystery Tackle Box](http://www.mysterytacklebox.com). I used the their coupon code GET499 to get this box for just $4.99. Out of everything that came in this box.

## 2.5RSC

The 2.5RSC by Reaction Strike was my favorite lure. The sound chamber in this thing is super loud and great for attracting fish is dirtier water. it has a good swim depth for shallow to medium deep waters.

## BD12 CrankBait

The BD12 Crankbait is a semi-deep running crankbait. With a swim depth of 10-12 feet. It seems to run with a nice medium wobble. One of the eyes fell off mine, and i have read that this has happened to others with this same bait. I just pulled the other eye off and glued on a new set.

## Vicious Ultimate Copolymer

I have never used copolymer before and the only reason I would buy any is as a mono replacement. It claims to have a low stretch and high sensitivity, but it is still fairly stretchy and didn't feel super sensitive to me, but I haven't fished with anything other than braid and flourocarbon for years.

## Salt Bang-O

I already had some worms nearly identical to the Salt Bang-O's, so I haven't used them yet, but will eventually put them to use. They are a great worm for fishing wacky style.

## Super Swimmer Jr.

I used these swim jigs mainly on a chatterbait with limited success. I threw it multiple times, then switched to a crankbait and caught fish. I'm sure is just what the fish were keying in on that day through. These are a great size bait with a good action.

## Wacky Weedless Jig Head

I was unable to catch a fish using these. I would have rather had a larger hook to weight ratio.

## BaitMate Live Gamefish

Only a small sample of this BaitMate came in the box, and I haven't used it yet. I've used similiar scents in the past and they do seem to help when the bite gets tough.
