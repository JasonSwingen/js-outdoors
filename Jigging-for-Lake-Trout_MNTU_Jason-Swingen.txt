title: Ice Fishing for Lake Trout in Lake Superior

# Introduction

It's not every year that Lake Superior Freezes over. So when it does, you should make sure you take advantage of it! There are a few different species that you can target including my favorite species to catch through the ice; the lake trout.

The first lake trout I had ever caught was one of the most memorable fish I have ever caught. Not just because it was my first lake trout, or biggest I've caught to this day, but because of the difference in my expectations vs the reality of reeling the drag screaming power these fish possess.

My first introduction to ice fishing on Lake Superior was seeing a group of ice shelters on the lake the first winter after moving to Duluth. I drove over to where a few fisherman were pulling their sleds back to shore and asked them what they were fishing for. "Lake Trout" one of the them said "no luck today though" said the other. They told me they were using white tube jigs and fishing in about 80 feet of water.

Other than the information I had received from those fishermen and the assumption that my 24" medium-light walleye rod wouldn't be big enough I made a quick stop to buy some new gear then set off onto the few inches of ice over the clear water of Lake Superior.

After two unsuccessful days of out on the ice I was starting to loose hope. I just mindlessly jigging on the bottom of the lake in 75 feet of water, starting to think that I was in the wrong area, using the wrong color, if I had turned the lights off in my car, if I had...BOOM! All of a sudden my rod nearly got ripped from my hands and my drag was screaming. After nearly 10 minutes I had finally gained enough ground to get the fish up to where I could see it in the super clear Lake Superior water. I was only able to get a short glimpse before it shot down all the way to the bottom of the lake and I had to start the battle again. After another 5 intense minutes I was able to get the fish up through the hole. It wasn't a giant compared some of the lake trout out there, but it was the biggest fish I had ever caught, and one that I would remember forever.

The first lake trout I ever caught was the fish pictured above. Using a 3.5" white tube jig in 75 feet of water. I let the jig free fall until it hit bottom then bounce it against the ground a few times and lifted up a few  it a few feet off the bottom. After a few repetitions a huge mark showed up on my Marcum. I didn't even have time to set the hook. My rod was bend all the was over and my reel was screaming. It took five minutes until I finally saw him. It is amazing seeing these fish fight through such clear ice and water. You can usually see 30 feet down through the clear Lake Superior water and the ice is often like glass. Once it got towards the hole it peeled off again going all the way back to the bottom of the lake. The entire fight too over 10 minutes. He ended up weighing over 15 pounds and 3 feet long! To this day it is one of my favorite fishing memories.

The ice conditions are still good out of Duluth with ice ranging from 8-24 inches! There are still plenty of active fish around.

Even if Lake Superior doesn't freeze over near Duluth, there are often opportunities to target lake trout around the Apostle Islands and other inland lakes in Northern Minnesota. Now is a great time to get your equipment ready!

Catching lakers is a whole different world that catching walleye and panfish. Not only will you need to upsize your equipment, you'll need to use different tactics to get them to bite. But before we get into techniques, lets cover the basic equipment you'll need.

### Rod

Although you could land a smaller lake trout on a walleye rod, it would be worth investing in a heavy action rod at least 32" long. Generally these rods aren't that expensive and you can pick one up for less than $40. If you are targeting lake trout (especially in Lake Superior) you have the potential of catching a giant that could weigh 30 pounds or more! You don't want to loose a trophy because you entered the fight under-gunned.

You can use either a spinning rod or a baitcaster. Each has their pros and cons. Spinning setups are more common, cheaper and generally will have a better drag. The number one benefit of using a baitcasting rod/reel is that they reduce line-twist which can be compounded when you are fishing in over 100 feet of water.

### Reel
Your typical 200 or 300 size spinning reels that you use for walleye and bass are ideal. If you are using a baitcasting rod, having a spool with a large capicity is a must. Having a reel that is strong and smooth is also a must.

### Line
Spool up your reel with at least 100 yards of line of 20lb braid. Lake trout are typically caught in deep water and can easily pull 100 feet of line on their long powerful runs. Braid is important in order to set the hook in deep water as well as keep your line from bowing in in the current.

Use a high quality swivel at the end of your braid, then tie on a few feet of 10-20lb flourocarbon. Lake Superior has extremely clear water so using a strong, nearly invisible leader is important. If you are using a baitcaster it's optional to skip the swivel and tie straight to your leader. Then you can use a leader that is 10-20ft long. I prefer to use an FG Knot that can easily be reeled through the guides, but an albright knot is also a good choice for a braid to mono/flouro connection.

### Lures
I prefer to use white lures, but it's hard to say if that's because white works better, or because that is what I use more than any other color. Lake trout are often chasing down and eating smelt and herring, which are both mostly white in color. So why not try to match-the-hatch! Also, the louder and smellier the better. Adding rattles or tipping your hook with a fillet-o-smelt can make a major difference in your catch-rate. Some popular lures include jigging raps, rattling traps, spoons, tube jigs, swim baits, bucktails, and other similar jigs. Half to 1 ounce jigs are ideal for fishing in water that is 100ft or less. If you are fishing in over 120ft of water or there is a heavy current you'll want to use lures between 1 and 2 ounces.

Leave your finesse lures at home. Lake trout can be extremely aggressive and will swim from the bottom of the lake to a few feet from the ice while chasing down your lure (and sometimes back down again).

### Flasher
Having a good flasher is pretty much a necessity when ice fishing for lake trout. Half of fun comes from the excitement of marking a fish and watching it scream up to your lure. You can use any basic Marcum, Vexilar, or Hummingbird. Ideally having a graph with a screen that shows history will be the most productive allowing you to track these fish as they chase you up the water column.

## How to Fish For Them
Lake Trout are typically found in deep water from 60 to 200 feet of water or more. Typically when fishing for them you will want to focus on depths of 80 to 160 feet.

Two of the best tactics to catch lakers include "pounding the bottom", and "playing keep away". Sometimes just lifting your jig and dropping it against the lake bottom will kick up enough sediment to call in a laker. This can also be a great tactic if you don't have a flasher or fish finder.

Playing keep away is the most commonly used way to catch lake trout through the ice. It is not unheard of to have a fish shoot off the bottom and chase your lure 50, 60, 70 feet or more. One of the hardest habits to break is not finessing them. They will become uninterested if you try and entice them to bite like you would a walleye or panfish. If you mark a fish, start reeling! Typically the marks that show up mid column are more active fish and will chase more readily. If you see a mark above you, real past them around 2-3 reel revolutions per second. They will often immediately start chasing. If they loose interest, drop your lure past them, sometimes your mark of your lure on your graph will stop at the fish. Set the hook hard and hold on!

## Where to Go
You can fish for lake trout anywhere that you can get to the right depths. Starting at 21st Ave E in downtown duluth there are a few great spots to get out on the ice and into deep water. Follow scenic highway north and you will find multiple locations that you can park and get to the ice.

## Safety First
Be careful out there, Even if there is 12" of ice in one area there can be cracks and ice heaves a few ft wide with skim ice. Bring a spud bar, rope, ice picks, and a buddy. Keep an eye on the wind as well. A strong wind from the west can push the ice out into the middle of the lake. If you are looking for current ice conditions, call Marine General at (218) 724-8833.
