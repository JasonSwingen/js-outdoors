JS-Outdoors is a blog written by Jason Swingen, an avid outdoorsman from the northland. I grew up in Northeastern Montana hunting mule deer, antelope, grouse, ducks, and pheasants as well as catching walleye, pike, and perch. After college I moved to North Carolina and started targeting bass and bluegill. I am now living in Duluth Minnesota and primarily hunting whitetail deer with my bow and primarily targeting bass, pike, steelhead, and trout with my fly rod.

## Why I hunt and fish
I started hunting not as a family tradition, or something that I was forced to do and just kept doing. I always liked being outside, shooting guns, shooting my bow, catching fish and I am always trying to experience new species to target and new ways to target them. Hunting and fishing is can be relaxing and heart-poundingly exciting. It is a great way to understand the world around you, as well as understand who you are and what you are capable of.
