<!-- ### From the Author -->

<!-- <blockquote>
  This website was started as personal hunting and fishing journal, but through the process of building, and marketing it was immediatly evident that the average hunter/angler wants a place to learn and see what other types of opportunities there are in their local area. The goal of this site is to share my personal experiences while sharing the knowledge I gain on the way!

<!-- ### Why I hunt and fish
I started hunting not as a family tradition, or something that I was forced to do and just kept doing. I always liked being outside, shooting guns, shooting my bow, catching fish and I am always trying to experience new species to target and new ways to target them. Hunting and fishing is can be relaxing and heart-poundingly exciting. It is a great way to understand the world around you, as well as understand who you are and what you are capable of. -->
